1
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:33,637
<i>Yes, this is Sunset Boulevard,
Los Angeles, California.</i>

2
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,099
<i>It's about 5:00 in the morning.</i>

3
00:01:37,182 --> 00:01:39,017
<i>That's the homicide squad,</i>

4
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:42,771
<i>complete with detectives and newspapermen.</i>

5
00:01:42,854 --> 00:01:45,941
<i>A murder has been reported from
one of those great big houses</i>

6
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:48,277
<i>in the 10,000 block.</i>

7
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,446
<i>You'll read about it
in the late editions, I'm sure.</i>

8
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,367
<i>You'll get it over your radio
and see it on television.</i>

9
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,621
<i>Because an old-time star is involved.
One of the biggest.</i>

10
00:02:01,206 --> 00:02:05,168
<i>But before you hear it all distorted
and blown out of proportion,</i>

11
00:02:05,252 --> 00:02:08,714
<i>before those Hollywood columnists
get their hands on it,</i>

12
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:12,217
<i>maybe you'd like to hear the facts.
The whole truth.</i>

13
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,389
<i>If so, you've come to the right party.</i>

14
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:21,810
<i>You see, the body of a young man was
found floating in the pool of her mansion</i>

15
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:25,314
<i>with two shots in his back
and one in his stomach.</i>

16
00:02:25,397 --> 00:02:27,232
<i>Nobody important, really.</i>

17
00:02:27,316 --> 00:02:31,153
<i>Just a movie writer
with a couple of B pictures to his credit.</i>

18
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:36,408
<i>The poor dope. He always wanted a pool.</i>

19
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:39,244
<i>Well, in the end, he got himself a pool,</i>

20
00:02:39,328 --> 00:02:42,372
<i>only the price
turned out to be a little high.</i>

21
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:50,005
<i>Let's go back about six months
and find the day when it all started.</i>

22
00:02:50,088 --> 00:02:54,301
<i>I was living in an apartment house
above Franklin and Ivar.</i>

23
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:56,803
<i>Things were tough at the moment.</i>

24
00:02:56,887 --> 00:03:00,974
<i>I hadn't worked in a studio
for a long time.</i>

25
00:03:01,058 --> 00:03:04,978
<i>So I sat there, grinding out
original stories, two a week.</i>

26
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:09,316
<i>Only I seemed to have lost my touch.</i>

27
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:12,319
<i>Maybe they weren't original enough.</i>

28
00:03:12,402 --> 00:03:15,155
<i>Maybe they were too original.</i>

29
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:17,824
<i>All I know is, they didn't sell.</i>

30
00:03:20,744 --> 00:03:21,870
Yeah?

31
00:03:31,838 --> 00:03:34,132
- Joseph C. Gillis?
- That's right.

32
00:03:34,216 --> 00:03:37,302
We've come for the car.

33
00:03:37,386 --> 00:03:38,637
What car?

34
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,558
1946 Plymouth convertible,
California license 40R-116.

35
00:03:43,642 --> 00:03:45,894
Where are the keys?

36
00:03:45,977 --> 00:03:47,604
Why should I give you the keys?

37
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:49,981
Because the company's
played ball with you long enough,

38
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:53,235
because you're three payments behind
and because we got a court order.

39
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:54,694
Now, come on. The keys.

40
00:03:54,778 --> 00:03:57,406
Or do you want us to jack it up
and haul it away?

41
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:01,410
- Relax, fans. The car isn't here.
- Oh, is that so?

42
00:04:01,493 --> 00:04:04,830
I loaned it to a friend of mine.
He took it down to Palm Springs.

43
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:07,082
Had to get away for his health, I suppose.

44
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:09,084
If you don't believe me,
look in the garage.

45
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:12,838
Sure, sure, we believe you.
Only now we want you to believe us.

46
00:04:12,921 --> 00:04:17,008
That car better be back here by noon
tomorrow or there's gonna be fireworks.

47
00:04:17,092 --> 00:04:19,177
You say the cutest things.

48
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:33,775
<i>Well, I needed about $290,</i>

49
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:37,612
<i>and I needed it real quick,
or I'd lose my car.</i>

50
00:04:37,696 --> 00:04:41,867
<i>It wasn't in Palm Springs,
and it wasn't in the garage.</i>

51
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,119
<i>I was way ahead of the finance company.</i>

52
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:48,540
<i>I knew they'd be coming around,
and I wasn't taking any chances.</i>

53
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:50,041
<i>So I kept it across the street</i>

54
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:54,212
<i>in a parking lot
behind Rudy's Shoeshine Parlor.</i>

55
00:04:54,296 --> 00:04:57,632
<i>Rudy never asked any questions
about your finances.</i>

56
00:04:57,716 --> 00:05:00,844
<i>He'd just look at your heels
and know the score.</i>

57
00:05:05,307 --> 00:05:08,727
<i>I had an original story
kicking around Paramount.</i>

58
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,521
<i>My agent told me it was dead as a doornail.</i>

59
00:05:11,605 --> 00:05:14,733
<i>But I knew a big shot over there
who'd always liked me.</i>

60
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:17,819
<i>And the time had come to take
a little advantage of it.</i>

61
00:05:17,903 --> 00:05:19,529
<i>His name was Sheldrake.</i>

62
00:05:19,613 --> 00:05:23,241
<i>He was a smart producer,
with a set of ulcers to prove it.</i>

63
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:29,331
All right, Gillis, you've got five minutes.
What's your story about?

64
00:05:29,414 --> 00:05:33,251
It's about a baseball player,
a rookie shortstop that's batting .347.

65
00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:34,878
Poor kid was once mixed up in a holdup.

66
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:36,505
But he's trying to go straight.

67
00:05:36,588 --> 00:05:38,715
Except there are a bunch of gamblers
that won't let him.

68
00:05:38,798 --> 00:05:42,177
So they tell the poor kid he's got to
throw the World Series or else, huh?

69
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,303
More or less, except for the end.

70
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:44,429
I've got a gimmick that's real good.

71
00:05:44,513 --> 00:05:45,972
Uh-huh. You got a title?

72
00:05:46,056 --> 00:05:48,225
<i>Bases Loaded.</i> There's a 40-page outline.

73
00:05:48,308 --> 00:05:52,354
Call Readers' Department. Find out
what they have on <i>Bases Loaded.</i>

74
00:05:53,563 --> 00:05:55,232
They're pretty hot about it
over at Twentieth,

75
00:05:55,607 --> 00:05:56,942
except I think Zanuck's all wet.

76
00:05:57,025 --> 00:05:59,528
Can you see Ty Power as a shortstop?

77
00:05:59,611 --> 00:06:02,280
You've got the best man for it
right here on this lot. Alan Ladd.

78
00:06:02,364 --> 00:06:03,990
Be a good change of pace for Ladd.

79
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:05,992
And there's another thing.
It's pretty simple to shoot.

80
00:06:06,076 --> 00:06:07,911
Lots of outdoor stuff.

81
00:06:07,994 --> 00:06:10,622
I bet you could make the whole thing
for under a million.

82
00:06:10,705 --> 00:06:11,748
Excuse me.

83
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:13,458
And there's a great little part
for Bill Demarest,

84
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:15,043
one of the trainers, an old-time player

85
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:17,796
who got beaned,
goes out of his head sometimes.

86
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,089
- Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Hello.

87
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:22,217
On that <i>Bases Loaded,</i>
I covered it with a two-page synopsis.

88
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,719
- Thank you.
- But I wouldn't bother.

89
00:06:24,803 --> 00:06:26,638
- What's wrong with it?
- It's from hunger.

90
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:28,765
Nothing for Ladd?

91
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:31,476
It's just a rehash of something
that wasn't very good to begin with.

92
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,563
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.
He wrote it.

93
00:06:34,646 --> 00:06:36,481
This is Miss Kramer.

94
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:40,402
The name is Schaefer. Betty Schaefer.

95
00:06:41,778 --> 00:06:44,823
Right now I wish I could crawl
in a hole and pull it in after me.

96
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:46,741
And if I could be of any help...

97
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:50,203
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I
just didn't think it was any good.

98
00:06:50,287 --> 00:06:52,872
I found it flat and trite.

99
00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:54,958
Exactly what kind of material
do you recommend?

100
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,876
James Joyce? Dostoyevsky?

101
00:06:57,002 --> 00:06:59,462
I just think that pictures
should say a little something.

102
00:06:59,546 --> 00:07:02,674
Oh, one of the message kids.
Just a story won't do.

103
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:04,092
You'd have turned down <i>Gone with the Wind.</i>

104
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:08,179
No, that was me. I said,
"Who wants to see a Civil War picture?"

105
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,143
Perhaps the reason I hated
<i>Bases Loaded</i> is that I knew your name.

106
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:14,728
I'd always heard that you had some talent.

107
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:16,813
That was last year.
This year I'm trying to earn a living.

108
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:20,483
So you take plot 27-A,
make it glossy, make it slick...

109
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:21,943
Those are dirty words.

110
00:07:22,027 --> 00:07:23,987
You sound like a bunch of New York critics.

111
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,283
- That'll be all, Miss Kramer... Schaefer.
- Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.

112
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:31,620
Next time I'll write you
<i>The Naked and the Dead.</i>

113
00:07:31,745 --> 00:07:36,875
Well, it seems like Zanuck
has got himself a baseball picture.

114
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,251
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think

115
00:07:38,335 --> 00:07:40,629
I thought this was going to win
any Academy Award.

116
00:07:40,712 --> 00:07:43,715
Of course, we're always
looking for a Betty Hutton.

117
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:46,968
- Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
- Frankly, no.

118
00:07:47,052 --> 00:07:51,848
Now wait a minute. If we made it a girls'
softball team, put in a few numbers.

119
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:56,645
Might make a cute musical. <i>It Happened
in the Bullpen: Story of a Woman.</i>

120
00:07:58,188 --> 00:08:00,690
Are you trying to be funny?
Because I'm all out of laughs.

121
00:08:00,774 --> 00:08:03,735
- I'm over a barrel. I need a job.
- I haven't got a thing.

122
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:06,363
Any kind of an assignment.
Additional dialog.

123
00:08:06,446 --> 00:08:08,448
There's nothing. Honest.

124
00:08:11,034 --> 00:08:13,495
Look, Mr. Sheldrake.

125
00:08:13,578 --> 00:08:16,748
Could you let me have 300 bucks
yourself, as a personal loan?

126
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:18,833
Could I? Gillis.

127
00:08:21,628 --> 00:08:24,255
Last year somebody talked me
into buying a ranch in the Valley.

128
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:27,092
So I borrowed the money from
the bank to pay for the ranch.

129
00:08:27,175 --> 00:08:30,345
This year I had to mortgage the ranch
so I could keep up my life insurance,

130
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:32,222
so I could borrow on my insurance...

131
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:38,853
<i>After that I drove down to headquarters.</i>

132
00:08:38,937 --> 00:08:42,023
<i>That's the way a lot of us
think about Schwab's drugstore.</i>

133
00:08:42,107 --> 00:08:46,111
<i>Kind of a combination office,
kaffeeklatsch and waiting room.</i>

134
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:49,823
<i>Waiting. Waiting for the gravy train.</i>

135
00:08:52,075 --> 00:08:56,955
<i>I got myself 10 nickels and started
sending out a general SOS.</i>

136
00:08:57,038 --> 00:08:59,999
<i>Couldn't get hold of my agent, naturally.</i>

137
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:03,503
<i>So then I called a pal of mine,
Artie Green,</i>

138
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:06,506
<i>an awful nice guy, an assistant director.</i>

139
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:09,551
<i>He could let me have 20.
But 20 wouldn't do.</i>

140
00:09:11,177 --> 00:09:14,347
<i>Then I talked to
a couple of yes-men at Metro.</i>

141
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:16,766
<i>To me they said no.</i>

142
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,646
<i>Finally I located that agent of mine.
The big faker.</i>

143
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,482
<i>Was he out digging up a job
for poor Joe Gillis?</i>

144
00:09:24,566 --> 00:09:28,570
<i>No. He was hard at work in Bel-Air,
making with the golf sticks.</i>

145
00:09:32,991 --> 00:09:36,703
So you need $300.
Of course I could give you $300.

146
00:09:36,786 --> 00:09:39,247
- Only I'm not going to.
- No?

147
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:43,418
Gillis, get this through your head.
I'm not just your agent. It's not the 10%.

148
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:45,503
- I'm your friend.
- You are?

149
00:09:45,587 --> 00:09:47,338
Don't you know
the finest things in the world

150
00:09:47,422 --> 00:09:49,090
have been written on an empty stomach?

151
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:53,052
Once a talent like yours gets into that
Mocambo-Romanoff rut, you're through.

152
00:09:53,136 --> 00:09:55,472
Forget Romanoffs.
It's the car I'm talking about!

153
00:09:55,555 --> 00:09:57,515
If I lose my car,
it's like having my legs cut off.

154
00:09:57,599 --> 00:09:59,100
Greatest thing that could happen to you.

155
00:09:59,184 --> 00:10:02,645
Now you'll have to sit behind
the typewriter. Now you'll have to write.

156
00:10:02,729 --> 00:10:06,733
What do you think I've been doing?
I need $300.

157
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:10,195
Sweetheart, maybe what you need
is another agent.

158
00:10:22,332 --> 00:10:26,419
<i>As I drove back towards town,
I took inventory of my prospects.</i>

159
00:10:26,503 --> 00:10:29,464
<i>They now added up to exactly zero.</i>

160
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:32,425
<i>Apparently I just didn't have
what it takes.</i>

161
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:36,638
<i>And the time had come to wrap up the
whole Hollywood deal and go home.</i>

162
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:38,139
<i>Maybe if I hocked all my junk</i>

163
00:10:38,223 --> 00:10:41,309
<i>there'd be enough
for a bus ticket back to Ohio.</i>

164
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:44,479
<i>Back to that $35-a-week job
behind the copy desk</i>

165
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:48,483
<i>at the </i>Dayton Evening Post,
<i>if it was still open.</i>

166
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:51,653
<i>Back to the smirking delight
of the whole office.</i>

167
00:10:51,736 --> 00:10:55,657
<i>"All right, you wise guys. Why don't you
go out and take a crack at Hollywood?"</i>

168
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,409
<i>"Maybe you think that you could make..."</i>

169
00:11:56,634 --> 00:11:59,929
<i>I had landed myself
in the driveway of some big mansion</i>

170
00:12:00,013 --> 00:12:02,891
<i>that looked run-down and deserted.</i>

171
00:12:02,974 --> 00:12:05,852
<i>At the end of the drive
was a lovely sight indeed,</i>

172
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:11,149
<i>a great big empty garage,
just standing there, going to waste.</i>

173
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:16,112
<i>If ever there was a place to stash away
a limping car with a hot license number.</i>

174
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,124
<i>There was another occupant in that garage,</i>

175
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:31,419
<i>an enormous, foreign-built automobile.</i>

176
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:34,923
<i>It must have burned up
ten gallons to a mile.</i>

177
00:12:35,006 --> 00:12:38,092
<i>It had a 1932 license.</i>

178
00:12:38,176 --> 00:12:42,013
<i>I figured that's when the owners
had moved out.</i>

179
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:44,724
<i>And I also figured I couldn't
go back to my apartment</i>

180
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:47,518
<i>now that those bloodhounds were onto me.</i>

181
00:12:47,602 --> 00:12:49,812
<i>The idea was to get to Artie Green's
and stay there</i>

182
00:12:49,896 --> 00:12:52,774
<i>until I could make that bus for Ohio.</i>

183
00:12:52,857 --> 00:12:56,444
<i>Once back in Dayton, I'd drop the
credit boys a picture postcard,</i>

184
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:59,364
<i>telling them where to pick up the jalopy.</i>

185
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:05,620
<i>It was a great big white elephant
of a place.</i>

186
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:09,457
<i>The kind crazy movie people
built in the crazy '20s.</i>

187
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,169
<i>A neglected house gets an unhappy look.</i>

188
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:15,838
<i>This one had it in spades.</i>

189
00:13:15,922 --> 00:13:19,425
<i>It was like that old woman
in </i>Great Expectations,

190
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:23,930
<i>that Miss Havisham in her rotting
wedding dress and her torn veil,</i>

191
00:13:24,013 --> 00:13:27,892
<i>taking it out on the world
because she'd been given the go-by.</i>

192
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:36,859
You there! Why are you so late?

193
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,572
Why have you kept me waiting so long?

194
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:53,084
In here.

195
00:14:00,258 --> 00:14:03,094
I just put my car in the garage.
I had a blowout. I thought maybe...

196
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:04,637
Go on in.

197
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:06,973
Look, maybe I'd better take my car
and get it off...

198
00:14:07,056 --> 00:14:08,599
Wipe your feet.

199
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:13,271
Go on.

200
00:14:18,109 --> 00:14:21,362
You're not properly dressed
for the occasion.

201
00:14:21,446 --> 00:14:25,658
- What's the occasion?
- Have him come up, Max.

202
00:14:25,742 --> 00:14:27,326
Up the stairs.

203
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:28,870
Suppose you listen to me for just a minute.

204
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:31,539
- Madame is waiting.
- For me?

205
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,126
Okay.

206
00:14:42,592 --> 00:14:45,636
If you need any help
with the coffin, call me.

207
00:15:05,156 --> 00:15:06,491
This way.

208
00:15:13,331 --> 00:15:15,458
In here.

209
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:18,586
I put him on my massage table
in front of the fire.

210
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:22,131
He always liked fires
and poking at them with a stick.

211
00:15:28,179 --> 00:15:30,723
I've made up my mind
we'll bury him in the garden.

212
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:33,434
Any city laws against that?

213
00:15:33,518 --> 00:15:35,770
- I wouldn't know.
- I don't care anyway.

214
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:40,066
I want the coffin to be white,
and I want it specially lined with satin.

215
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:42,276
White or deep pink.

216
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:49,742
Maybe red. Bright, flaming red.
Let's make it gay.

217
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:00,962
How much will it be?

218
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:05,633
I warn you, don't give me a fancy price
just because I'm rich!

219
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:10,471
Lady, you got the wrong man. I had
some trouble with my car. A flat tire.

220
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:13,850
I pulled into your garage
until I could get a spare.

221
00:16:13,933 --> 00:16:19,147
- I thought this was an empty house.
- It is not. Get out.

222
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:22,733
I'm sorry.
And I'm sorry you lost your friend.

223
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:26,320
And I don't think red is the right color.

224
00:16:26,404 --> 00:16:29,490
Wait a minute. Haven't I seen you
before? I know your face.

225
00:16:29,574 --> 00:16:33,828
- Get out. Or shall I call my servant?
- You're Norma Desmond!

226
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:37,707
You used to be in silent pictures.
You used to be big!

227
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:42,253
I am big. It's the pictures that got small.

228
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:46,674
I knew there was something wrong with them.

229
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:49,177
They're dead. They're finished.

230
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,511
There was a time in this business

231
00:16:50,595 --> 00:16:53,347
when they had the eyes
of the whole wide world.

232
00:16:53,431 --> 00:16:56,017
But that wasn't good enough for them.
Oh, no!

233
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,186
They had to have the ears
of the world, too.

234
00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:03,524
So they opened their big mouths
and out came talk, talk, talk.

235
00:17:03,608 --> 00:17:05,234
That's where the popcorn business comes in.

236
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:07,695
You buy yourself a bag
and plug up your ears.

237
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:11,365
Look at them in the front offices,
the masterminds!

238
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:13,618
They took the idols and smashed them.

239
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:16,454
The Fairbankses, the Gilberts,
the Valentinos!

240
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:19,290
And who have we got now? Some nobodies!

241
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:22,877
Don't blame me.
I'm not an executive, just a writer.

242
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,631
You are. Writing words, words, more words!

243
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:29,508
Well, you've made a rope of words
and strangled this business!

244
00:17:29,592 --> 00:17:32,386
But there's a microphone right there
to catch the last gurgles,

245
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,473
and Technicolor to photograph
the red, swollen tongue!

246
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:39,435
- You'll wake up the monkey.
- Get out! Max!

247
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:43,397
Next time I'll bring
my autograph album along.

248
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:46,943
Or maybe a hunk of cement,
and ask for your footprint.

249
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:54,909
- It's okay. Okay, I'm going.
- Just a minute, you.

250
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:57,578
- You're a writer, you said.
- Why?

251
00:17:57,662 --> 00:17:59,830
Are you or aren't you?

252
00:17:59,914 --> 00:18:01,874
That's what it says on my Guild card.

253
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:05,628
And you have written pictures, haven't you?

254
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:08,589
Sure have. Want a list of my credits?

255
00:18:08,673 --> 00:18:11,592
I want to ask you something. Come in here.

256
00:18:11,676 --> 00:18:14,428
Last one I wrote was about Okies
in the Dust Bowl.

257
00:18:14,512 --> 00:18:16,555
You'd never know it, because
when it reached the screen,

258
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:19,392
the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.

259
00:18:28,276 --> 00:18:29,694
Intimate, isn't it?

260
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:36,367
The wind gets in that blasted pipe
organ. I ought to have it taken out.

261
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,786
Or teach it a better tune.

262
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:41,122
Young man, tell me something.

263
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:45,126
How long is a movie script these days?
I mean, how many pages?

264
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:47,795
Depends on what it is,
a <i>Donald Duck</i> or a <i>Joan of Arc.</i>

265
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:53,175
This is to be a very important picture.
I've written it myself. Took me years.

266
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:55,428
Looks like enough
for six important pictures.

267
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:58,806
It's a story of Salome.
I think I'll have DeMille direct it.

268
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:01,309
DeMille?

269
00:19:01,392 --> 00:19:04,979
- We made a lot of pictures together.
- And you'll play Salome.

270
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:08,524
Who else?

271
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:11,068
Only asking. I didn't know
you were planning a comeback.

272
00:19:11,152 --> 00:19:14,113
I hate that word! It's a return!

273
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,823
A return to the millions of people

274
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:18,826
who have never forgiven me
for deserting the screen.

275
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:24,540
- Fair enough.
- Salome. What a woman. What a part!

276
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:26,959
The princess in love with a holy man.

277
00:19:27,043 --> 00:19:29,128
She dances the dance of the seven veils.

278
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:33,090
He rejects her, so she demands
his head on a golden tray.

279
00:19:33,174 --> 00:19:37,303
Kissing his cold, dead lips.

280
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:41,015
- They'll love it in Pomona.
- They'll love it every place.

281
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:43,726
Read it. Read the scene
just before she has him killed.

282
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:46,187
Never let another writer read
your material. He may steal it.

283
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,774
I'm not afraid. Read it.
Max, bring something to drink.

284
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:54,904
- Sit down. Is there enough light?
- I've got 20-20 vision.

285
00:19:56,364 --> 00:19:57,990
I said sit down.

286
00:20:02,203 --> 00:20:05,039
<i>Well, I had no pressing engagement,</i>

287
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:08,167
<i>except with those boys
from the finance office.</i>

288
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,379
<i>And she'd mentioned
something to drink. Why not?</i>

289
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:18,427
<i>Sometimes it's interesting to see
just how bad, bad writing can be.</i>

290
00:20:18,511 --> 00:20:21,430
<i>This promised to go the limit.</i>

291
00:20:21,514 --> 00:20:23,391
<i>I wondered what a handwriting expert</i>

292
00:20:23,474 --> 00:20:26,310
<i>would make of that childish scrawl of hers.</i>

293
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:32,400
<i>Max wheeled in some champagne
and some caviar.</i>

294
00:20:32,483 --> 00:20:37,947
<i>Later I found out that Max was the only
other person in that grim Sunset castle.</i>

295
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,492
<i>And I found out
a few other things about him.</i>

296
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:45,579
<i>As for her, she sat
coiled up like a watch spring,</i>

297
00:20:45,663 --> 00:20:48,582
<i>her cigarette clamped in a curious holder.</i>

298
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,919
<i>I could sense her eyes on me
from behind those dark glasses,</i>

299
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:54,964
<i>defying me not to like what I read.</i>

300
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:59,260
<i>Or maybe begging me
in her own proud way to like it.</i>

301
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:01,345
<i>It meant so much to her.</i>

302
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:13,732
<i>It sure was a cozy setup,
that bundle of raw nerves and Max</i>

303
00:21:13,816 --> 00:21:15,985
<i>and a dead monkey upstairs.</i>

304
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:19,697
<i>And the wind wheezing through
that organ once in a while.</i>

305
00:21:27,288 --> 00:21:33,085
<i>Later on, just for comedy relief,
the real guy arrived with the baby coffin.</i>

306
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:38,507
<i>It was all done with great dignity.</i>

307
00:21:38,591 --> 00:21:41,802
<i>He must have been a very important chimp.</i>

308
00:21:41,886 --> 00:21:44,680
<i>The great-grandson of King Kong, maybe.</i>

309
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:50,644
<i>It got to be 11:00.</i>

310
00:21:50,728 --> 00:21:53,189
<i>I was feeling a little sick at my stomach,</i>

311
00:21:53,272 --> 00:21:57,485
<i>what with that sweet champagne
and that tripe I'd been reading,</i>

312
00:21:57,568 --> 00:22:02,031
<i>that silly hodgepodge
of melodramatic plots.</i>

313
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:07,411
<i>However, by then, I'd started
concocting a little plot of my own.</i>

314
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:11,332
Well?

315
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:14,251
- This is fascinating.
- Of course it is.

316
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:19,048
Maybe it's a little long and maybe
there's some repetitions,

317
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:22,009
but you're not a professional writer.

318
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:27,348
- I wrote that with my heart.
- Sure you did.

319
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:29,600
That's what makes it great.

320
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:35,147
What it needs is
maybe a little more dialog.

321
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:37,900
What for?
I can say anything I want with my eyes.

322
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:40,361
Well, it certainly could use
a pair of shears and a blue pencil.

323
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:42,863
I will not have it butchered.

324
00:22:42,947 --> 00:22:46,825
Of course not,
but it ought to be organized.

325
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:49,161
Just an editing job. You can find somebody.

326
00:22:49,245 --> 00:22:53,207
Who?
I'd have to have somebody I could trust.

327
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:56,126
When were you born?
I mean, what sign of the zodiac?

328
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:59,380
- I don't know.
- What month?

329
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:01,382
December 21.

330
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:05,928
Sagittarius. I like Sagittarians.
You can trust them.

331
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:09,181
- Thank you.
- I want you to do this work.

332
00:23:09,265 --> 00:23:11,350
Me?

333
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:15,312
I'm busy. I just finished a script,
and I'm due on another assignment.

334
00:23:15,396 --> 00:23:18,190
I don't care.

335
00:23:18,274 --> 00:23:22,611
You know, I'm pretty expensive.
I get 500 a week.

336
00:23:22,695 --> 00:23:27,241
I wouldn't worry about money.
I'll make it worth your while.

337
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:29,577
Maybe I'd better take the rest
of the script home and read it.

338
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,163
Oh, no! I couldn't let it out of my house.
You'll have to finish it here.

339
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:35,416
Well, it's getting kind of late.

340
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:39,878
- Are you married, Mr...
- Name is Gillis. Single.

341
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:43,424
- Where do you live?
- Hollywood. Alto Nido Apartments.

342
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:45,467
There's something wrong
with your car, you said.

343
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:47,678
There sure is.

344
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:51,432
- Why shouldn't you stay here?
- Look, I'll come back early tomorrow.

345
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:55,102
Nonsense. There's a room over the garage.

346
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:57,688
Max will take you there. Max!

347
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:06,822
<i>I felt kind of pleased
with the way I'd handled the situation.</i>

348
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:10,242
<i>I dropped the hook and she snapped at it.</i>

349
00:24:10,326 --> 00:24:15,497
<i>Now my car would be safe down below
while I did a patch-up job on the script.</i>

350
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:18,417
<i>And there should be plenty of money in it.</i>

351
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:26,467
This room hasn't been used for a long time.

352
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:30,054
It'll never make <i>House Beautiful,</i>
but I guess it's okay for one night.

353
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:32,056
I made your bed this afternoon.

354
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:36,560
Thanks. How did you know I was
gonna stay this afternoon?

355
00:24:36,644 --> 00:24:41,023
The bathroom's over there. I put in
some towels, soap and a toothbrush.

356
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:49,448
Say, she's quite a character,
that Norma Desmond.

357
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:53,577
She was the greatest of them all.
You wouldn't know. You're too young.

358
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:57,206
In one week she received
17,000 fan letters.

359
00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:00,876
Men bribed her hairdresser
to get a lock of her hair.

360
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:03,379
There was a maharajah
who came all the way from India

361
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:07,758
to beg one of her silk stockings.
Later he strangled himself with it.

362
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,305
Well, I sure turned in
to an interesting driveway.

363
00:25:13,389 --> 00:25:16,183
You did, sir. Good night, sir.

364
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:26,235
<i>I pegged him as slightly cuckoo, too.</i>

365
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:29,029
<i>A stroke, maybe.</i>

366
00:25:29,113 --> 00:25:32,574
<i>Come to think of it, the whole
place seemed to have been stricken</i>

367
00:25:32,658 --> 00:25:38,247
<i>with a kind of creeping paralysis,
out of beat with the rest of the world,</i>

368
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:41,583
<i>crumbling apart in slow motion.</i>

369
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:46,755
<i>There was a tennis court,
or rather the ghost of a tennis court,</i>

370
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:49,508
<i>with faded markings and a sagging net.</i>

371
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:58,934
<i>And, of course, she had a pool.
Who didn't then?</i>

372
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:04,565
<i>Mabel Normand and John Gilbert must
have swum in it 10,000 midnights ago.</i>

373
00:26:04,648 --> 00:26:08,569
<i>And Vilma Banky and Rod La Rocque.</i>

374
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:11,739
<i>It was empty now. Or was it?</i>

375
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:21,498
<i>There was something else going on below.</i>

376
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:28,380
<i>The last rites for that hairy old chimp,
performed with the utmost seriousness.</i>

377
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:32,593
<i>As if she were
laying to rest an only child.</i>

378
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:37,181
<i>Was her life really as empty as that?</i>

379
00:26:46,982 --> 00:26:52,070
<i>It was all very queer.
But queerer things were yet to come.</i>

380
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:03,582
<i>That night I had a mixed-up dream.</i>

381
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:06,335
<i>In it, there was an organ grinder.</i>

382
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:10,422
<i>I couldn't see his face,
but the organ was all draped in black,</i>

383
00:27:10,506 --> 00:27:14,301
<i>and a chimp was dancing for pennies.</i>

384
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:18,806
<i>When I opened my eyes,
the music was still there.</i>

385
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:20,349
<i>Where was I?</i>

386
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,104
<i>Oh, yes.
In that empty room over her garage.</i>

387
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:32,236
<i>Only it wasn't empty anymore.
I'd had a visitor.</i>

388
00:27:33,654 --> 00:27:35,322
<i>Somebody had brought in all my belongings.</i>

389
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:38,075
<i>My books, my typewriter, my clothes.</i>

390
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:41,829
<i>What was going on?</i>

391
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:05,894
Hey, you! Max, whatever your name is,
what are my things doing here?

392
00:28:05,978 --> 00:28:10,315
I'm talking to you! My clothes
and things are up in the room!

393
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:16,405
- Naturally. I brought them myself.
- Is that so?

394
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:19,491
Why, what's the matter?
Is there anything missing?

395
00:28:19,575 --> 00:28:21,243
Who said you could? Who asked you to?

396
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:25,747
I did. I don't know why
you should be so upset.

397
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:27,541
Stop that playing, Max.

398
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:31,128
It seemed like a good idea
if we are to work together.

399
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:34,673
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.

400
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:36,717
There's nothing in the deal
about my staying here!

401
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,051
You'll like it here.

402
00:28:38,135 --> 00:28:40,095
Thanks for the invitation.
I've got my own apartment.

403
00:28:40,178 --> 00:28:42,764
You can't work in an apartment
where you owe three months' rent.

404
00:28:42,848 --> 00:28:46,810
- I'll take care of that.
- It's all taken care of, it's all paid for.

405
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:52,149
Okay, we'll deduct it from my salary.

406
00:28:52,232 --> 00:28:56,403
Now, now, don't let's be small about
such matters. We won't keep books.

407
00:28:56,486 --> 00:29:01,408
- Max, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
- It is done, Madame.

408
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:03,911
Well, pack them up again!
I didn't say I was staying!

409
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:08,040
Suppose you make up your mind.
Do you want this job or don't you?

410
00:29:11,293 --> 00:29:13,086
<i>Yes, I wanted the job.</i>

411
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:16,798
<i>I wanted the dough, and I wanted
to get out of there as quickly as I could.</i>

412
00:29:17,174 --> 00:29:21,511
<i>I thought if I really got going,
I could finish it up in a couple of weeks.</i>

413
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:23,889
<i>But it wasn't so simple
getting some coherence</i>

414
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:26,975
<i>into those wild hallucinations of hers.</i>

415
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:30,812
<i>And what made it even tougher was
that she was around all the time,</i>

416
00:29:30,896 --> 00:29:35,943
<i>hovering over me, afraid I'd do injury
to that precious brainchild of hers.</i>

417
00:29:42,658 --> 00:29:46,578
- What's that?
- Just a scene I threw out.

418
00:29:46,662 --> 00:29:48,038
Which scene?

419
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:49,623
The one where you go to the slave market.

420
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:51,249
It's better to cut directly
to John the Baptist...

421
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,877
Cut away from me?

422
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:56,713
Honestly, it's a little too much of you.
They don't want you in every scene.

423
00:29:56,797 --> 00:30:00,050
They don't? Then why do they still
write me fan letters every day?

424
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:01,635
Why do they beg me for my photographs?

425
00:30:01,718 --> 00:30:06,890
Why? Because they want to see me.
Me! Norma Desmond.

426
00:30:06,974 --> 00:30:09,726
- Put it back.
- Okay.

427
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:26,618
<i>I didn't argue with her.</i>

428
00:30:26,702 --> 00:30:31,248
<i>You don't yell at a sleepwalker.
He may fall and break his neck.</i>

429
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:32,666
<i>That's it.</i>

430
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:36,670
<i>She was still sleepwalking along
the giddy heights of a lost career.</i>

431
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:41,675
<i>Plain crazy when it came to that
one subject, her celluloid self,</i>

432
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:44,219
<i>the great Norma Desmond.</i>

433
00:30:44,302 --> 00:30:47,973
<i>How could she breathe in that house
so crowded with Norma Desmonds,</i>

434
00:30:49,141 --> 00:30:50,934
<i>more Norma Desmonds</i>

435
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:54,438
<i>and still more Norma Desmonds?</i>

436
00:30:56,857 --> 00:30:59,234
<i>It wasn't all work, of course.</i>

437
00:30:59,317 --> 00:31:02,988
<i>Two or three times a week, Max would
haul up that enormous oil painting</i>

438
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:06,992
<i>that had been presented to her by
some Nevada Chamber of Commerce</i>

439
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:11,038
<i>and we'd see a movie,
right in her living room.</i>

440
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:14,666
<i>So much nicer than going out, she'd say.</i>

441
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:19,171
<i>The plain fact was she was afraid
of that world outside.</i>

442
00:31:19,254 --> 00:31:22,340
<i>Afraid it would remind her
that time had passed.</i>

443
00:31:24,342 --> 00:31:29,056
<i>They were silent movies, and Max
would run the projection machine,</i>

444
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:31,224
<i>which was just as well.</i>

445
00:31:31,308 --> 00:31:33,101
<i>It kept him from giving us an accompaniment</i>

446
00:31:33,185 --> 00:31:35,145
<i>on that wheezing organ.</i>

447
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:39,566
<i>She'd sit very close to me</i>

448
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:42,986
<i>and she smelled of tuberoses,
which is not my favorite perfume,</i>

449
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,363
<i>not by a long shot.</i>

450
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:49,659
<i>Sometimes as we watched,
she'd clutch my arm or my hand,</i>

451
00:31:49,743 --> 00:31:51,953
<i>forgetting she was my employer.</i>

452
00:31:52,037 --> 00:31:56,416
<i>Just becoming a fan, excited about
that actress up there on the screen.</i>

453
00:31:58,835 --> 00:32:02,422
<i>I guess I don't have to tell you
who the star was.</i>

454
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:06,927
<i>They were always her pictures.
That's all she wanted to see.</i>

455
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:38,625
Still wonderful, isn't it? And no dialog.

456
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:41,336
We didn't need dialog. We had faces.

457
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:46,091
There just aren't any faces
like that anymore.

458
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:48,385
Maybe one, Garbo.

459
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:54,224
Oh, those idiot producers. Those imbeciles.

460
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:57,394
Haven't they got any eyes? Have they
forgotten what a star looks like?

461
00:32:57,477 --> 00:33:00,772
I'll show them.
I'll be up there again, so help me!

462
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:14,244
<i>Sometimes there'd be
a little bridge game in the house,</i>

463
00:33:14,327 --> 00:33:16,663
<i>at a twentieth of a cent a point.</i>

464
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:18,832
<i>I'd get half of her winnings</i>

465
00:33:18,915 --> 00:33:21,209
<i>once they ran up to 70 cents,</i>

466
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:24,671
<i>which was about
the only cash money I ever got.</i>

467
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:27,757
<i>The others around the table
would be actor friends.</i>

468
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:31,678
<i>Dim figures you may still remember
from the silent days.</i>

469
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:34,514
<i>I used to think of them as her waxworks.</i>

470
00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:36,975
- One diamond.
- One heart.

471
00:33:39,936 --> 00:33:42,314
- Spade.
- Pass.

472
00:33:43,732 --> 00:33:45,609
- Three no-trump.
- Pass.

473
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,445
Pass.

474
00:33:48,528 --> 00:33:51,281
Empty the ashtray, will you, Joe, dear?

475
00:34:19,392 --> 00:34:20,518
There are some men outside,

476
00:34:20,602 --> 00:34:21,937
- they asked for you.
- I'm not here.

477
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,939
- That's what I told them.
- Good.

478
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:28,443
But they found your car in the garage,
and they're going to tow it away.

479
00:34:28,526 --> 00:34:31,863
Where's the ashtray?
Joe, can't we have the ashtray?

480
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:41,248
I want to talk to you for a minute.

481
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:43,667
Not now, my dear.
I'm playing three no-trump.

482
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,418
They've come for my car.

483
00:34:45,502 --> 00:34:48,838
Please. Now I've forgotten
how many spades are out.

484
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:52,425
- Look, I need some money right now.
- Can't you wait until I'm dummy?

485
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:55,262
- No.
- Please.

486
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:34,509
- Now what is it? Where's the fire?
- I've lost my car.

487
00:35:34,592 --> 00:35:36,469
And I thought it was
a matter of life and death.

488
00:35:36,553 --> 00:35:39,389
It is, to me.
That's why I came to this house.

489
00:35:39,472 --> 00:35:41,808
That's why I took this job ghostwriting.

490
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:45,603
Now you're being silly.
We don't need two cars. We have a car.

491
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:48,982
Not one of those cheap new things
made of chromium and spit.

492
00:35:49,065 --> 00:35:53,194
An Isotta-Fraschini. Have you
ever heard of Isotta-Fraschini?

493
00:35:53,278 --> 00:35:56,740
All handmade. Cost me $28,000.

494
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:03,830
<i>So Max got that old bus
down off its blocks and polished it up.</i>

495
00:36:04,914 --> 00:36:07,751
<i>She'd take me for rides
in the hills above Sunset.</i>

496
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:12,297
<i>The whole thing was upholstered
in leopard skin</i>

497
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:16,384
<i>and had one of those car phones,
all gold-plated.</i>

498
00:36:18,553 --> 00:36:22,057
- That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
- What's wrong with it?

499
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,850
Nothing, if you work in the filling station.

500
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:28,438
And I'm getting rather bored with that
sport jacket and the same baggy pants.

501
00:36:30,315 --> 00:36:35,028
Max, what's a good men's shop in town?
The very best? Well, go there.

502
00:36:35,111 --> 00:36:38,281
I don't need any clothes, and I certainly
don't want you buying them for me.

503
00:36:38,365 --> 00:36:42,994
Why begrudge me a little fun?
I just want you to look nice.

504
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:44,954
And must you chew gum?

505
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:55,173
Now there's nothing like
blue flannel for a man.

506
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:57,258
Now this one, single-breasted, of course.

507
00:36:57,342 --> 00:37:00,887
Now we need a topcoat. Let me see
what you have in camel's hair.

508
00:37:01,137 --> 00:37:03,932
- How about some evening clothes?
- I don't need a tuxedo.

509
00:37:04,015 --> 00:37:06,726
Of course you do. A tuxedo and tails,
and if you aren't careful,

510
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,895
you'll get a cutaway.

511
00:37:08,978 --> 00:37:10,397
Tails! That's ridiculous.

512
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,774
You need them for parties.
You need them for New Year's Eve.

513
00:37:12,857 --> 00:37:16,152
- Where are your evening clothes?
- This way, Madame.

514
00:37:19,697 --> 00:37:22,534
Here are some camel's hair,
but I'd like you just to feel this.

515
00:37:22,617 --> 00:37:25,078
It's vicuna.
Of course, it's a little more expensive.

516
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:27,205
The camel's hair will do.

517
00:37:29,332 --> 00:37:33,503
Well, as long as the lady's paying for it,
why not take the vicuna?

518
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:47,350
<i>The last week in December, the rains came.</i>

519
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:50,061
<i>A great big package of rain,</i>

520
00:37:50,145 --> 00:37:54,274
<i>oversized, like everything else
in California.</i>

521
00:37:54,357 --> 00:37:58,319
<i>It came right through the old roof
of my room above the garage.</i>

522
00:38:00,029 --> 00:38:03,116
<i>She had Max move me to the main house.</i>

523
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:05,785
<i>I didn't much like the idea.</i>

524
00:38:05,869 --> 00:38:09,789
<i>The only time I could have to myself
was in that room.</i>

525
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:13,585
<i>But it was better than sleeping
in a raincoat and galoshes.</i>

526
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:55,001
- Whose room was this?
- It was the room of the husband.

527
00:38:55,084 --> 00:38:59,255
Of the husbands, I should say.
Madame has been married three times.

528
00:39:05,136 --> 00:39:07,972
I guess that's the one
you can see Catalina from.

529
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:10,058
Only this isn't the day.

530
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:26,783
Say, what's this with the door?
There isn't any lock.

531
00:39:27,784 --> 00:39:30,912
There are no locks anywhere
in this house, sir.

532
00:39:36,626 --> 00:39:40,088
How come? There must be a reason.

533
00:39:40,171 --> 00:39:42,882
- The doctor suggested it.
- What doctor?

534
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:48,263
Madame's doctor.
Madame has moments of melancholy.

535
00:39:48,346 --> 00:39:52,141
There have been some attempts at suicide.

536
00:39:52,225 --> 00:39:56,145
We have to be very careful.
No sleeping pills, no razor blades.

537
00:39:56,229 --> 00:40:00,024
We shut off the gas in Madame's bedroom.

538
00:40:00,108 --> 00:40:02,151
Why? Her career?

539
00:40:02,235 --> 00:40:04,195
She got enough out of it.
She's not forgotten.

540
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:05,947
She still gets those fan letters.

541
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:08,992
I wouldn't look too closely
at the postmarks.

542
00:40:12,078 --> 00:40:15,582
You send them. Is that it, Max?

543
00:40:15,665 --> 00:40:18,459
I had better press
your evening clothes, sir.

544
00:40:18,543 --> 00:40:22,046
Mr. Gillis has not forgotten
Madame's New Year's party?

545
00:40:23,172 --> 00:40:27,594
No, no, I haven't.
I suppose all the waxworks are coming.

546
00:40:27,677 --> 00:40:31,014
I wouldn't know, sir.
Madame made the arrangements.

547
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:52,827
<i>There it was again.</i>

548
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:57,290
<i>That room of hers, all satin and ruffles.</i>

549
00:40:57,373 --> 00:41:00,251
<i>And that bed like a gilded rowboat.</i>

550
00:41:00,335 --> 00:41:03,171
<i>The perfect setting
for a silent movie queen.</i>

551
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:06,549
<i>Poor devil.</i>

552
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:10,845
<i>Still waving proudly to a parade
which had long since passed her by.</i>

553
00:41:14,807 --> 00:41:18,603
<i>It was at her New Year's party that
I found out how she felt about me.</i>

554
00:41:19,604 --> 00:41:23,358
<i>Maybe I'd been an idiot
not to have sensed it was coming.</i>

555
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:26,277
<i>That sad, embarrassing revelation.</i>

556
00:41:31,532 --> 00:41:32,909
Joe!

557
00:41:38,414 --> 00:41:41,668
You look absolutely divine.

558
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:43,127
- Turn around.
- Please.

559
00:41:43,211 --> 00:41:48,841
Come on. Perfect. Wonderful shoulders.
I love that line.

560
00:41:48,925 --> 00:41:51,928
It's all padding. Don't let it fool you.

561
00:41:52,011 --> 00:41:53,388
You know, to me,
getting dressed up was always

562
00:41:53,471 --> 00:41:55,181
just putting on my dark blue suit.

563
00:41:55,264 --> 00:41:56,516
I don't like the stud they sent.

564
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:59,018
I want you to have a pearl.
A big, luscious pearl.

565
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:02,522
Well, I'm not going to wear
earrings, I can tell you that.

566
00:42:02,605 --> 00:42:04,691
Cute. Come on, let's have a drink.

567
00:42:04,774 --> 00:42:08,528
- Shouldn't we wait for the others?
- Max, champagne.

568
00:42:08,611 --> 00:42:11,322
Careful, it's slippery. I had it waxed.

569
00:42:13,741 --> 00:42:15,618
Here's to us.

570
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:19,580
You know, this floor used to be wood,
but I had it changed.

571
00:42:19,664 --> 00:42:24,544
Valentino said
there's nothing like tile for a tango.

572
00:42:24,627 --> 00:42:27,547
- Come on.
- Not on the same floor with Valentino.

573
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,173
Just follow me.

574
00:42:47,692 --> 00:42:49,610
Don't bend back like that.

575
00:42:49,694 --> 00:42:52,822
- It's that thing. It tickles.
- It does?

576
00:43:18,681 --> 00:43:21,476
It's quarter past 10. What time
are they supposed to get here?

577
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:23,144
- Who?
- The other guests.

578
00:43:23,227 --> 00:43:24,771
There are no other guests.

579
00:43:25,062 --> 00:43:27,440
We don't want to share this night
with other people.

580
00:43:27,523 --> 00:43:29,859
This is for you and me.

581
00:43:29,942 --> 00:43:33,029
- Oh?
- Hold me tighter.

582
00:43:33,112 --> 00:43:34,489
Okay.

583
00:43:36,073 --> 00:43:38,785
Come midnight, how about
blindfolding the orchestra

584
00:43:38,868 --> 00:43:41,621
and smashing champagne glasses
over Max's head?

585
00:43:41,704 --> 00:43:44,749
- You think this is all very funny.
- A little.

586
00:43:52,924 --> 00:43:55,968
<i>An hour dragged by.</i>

587
00:43:56,052 --> 00:44:00,223
<i>I felt caught, like the cigarette
in that contraption on her finger.</i>

588
00:44:05,186 --> 00:44:10,483
What a wonderful next year it's
going to be. What fun we'll have!

589
00:44:10,566 --> 00:44:12,068
I'll fill the pool for you.

590
00:44:12,151 --> 00:44:15,530
I'll open my house in Malibu,
and you can have the whole ocean.

591
00:44:15,613 --> 00:44:18,491
And when our picture is finished,
I'll buy you a boat

592
00:44:18,574 --> 00:44:20,576
and we'll sail to Hawaii...

593
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,620
Stop it. You're not going
to buy me anything more.

594
00:44:22,703 --> 00:44:24,622
Don't be silly.

595
00:44:24,705 --> 00:44:27,834
Here.
I was going to give it to you at midnight.

596
00:44:30,419 --> 00:44:32,713
Norma, I can't take it.
You've bought me enough.

597
00:44:32,797 --> 00:44:34,423
Shut up. I'm rich.

598
00:44:34,507 --> 00:44:38,010
I'm richer than all this
new Hollywood trash.

599
00:44:38,094 --> 00:44:39,929
- I've got $1,000,000.
- Keep it.

600
00:44:40,012 --> 00:44:44,559
I own three blocks downtown.
I've got oil in Bakersfield.

601
00:44:44,642 --> 00:44:47,645
Pumping, pumping, pumping.

602
00:44:47,728 --> 00:44:50,231
What's it for
but to buy us anything we want?

603
00:44:50,314 --> 00:44:53,150
Cut out that "us" business!

604
00:44:53,234 --> 00:44:54,652
What's the matter with you?

605
00:44:54,735 --> 00:44:57,363
What right do you have
to take me for granted?

606
00:44:58,489 --> 00:45:01,158
What right? Do you want me to tell you?

607
00:45:03,536 --> 00:45:05,872
Has it ever occurred to you
that I may have a life of my own?

608
00:45:05,955 --> 00:45:09,709
That there may be some girl
that I'm crazy about?

609
00:45:09,792 --> 00:45:13,462
Who? Some carhop or dress extra?

610
00:45:13,588 --> 00:45:16,215
What I'm trying to say is
that I'm all wrong for you.

611
00:45:16,299 --> 00:45:20,219
You want a Valentino, somebody
with polo ponies. A big shot.

612
00:45:20,303 --> 00:45:23,764
What you're trying to say is
you don't want me to love you.

613
00:45:23,848 --> 00:45:26,142
Say it. Say it!

614
00:46:42,969 --> 00:46:46,973
<i>I didn't know where I was going.
I just had to get out of there.</i>

615
00:46:47,723 --> 00:46:52,103
<i>I had to be with people my own age.
I had to hear somebody laugh again.</i>

616
00:46:55,064 --> 00:46:57,149
<i>I thought of Artie Green.</i>

617
00:46:57,233 --> 00:46:59,318
<i>There was bound to be
a New Year's shindig going on</i>

618
00:46:59,402 --> 00:47:01,904
<i>in his apartment down on Las Palmas.</i>

619
00:47:01,988 --> 00:47:05,741
<i>Writers without a job,
composers without a publisher,</i>

620
00:47:05,825 --> 00:47:10,204
<i>actresses so young they still believe
the guys in the casting offices.</i>

621
00:47:10,287 --> 00:47:15,251
<i>A bunch of kids who didn't give a hoot
just so long as they had a yuk to share.</i>

622
00:47:17,086 --> 00:47:22,758
<i>♪ Hollywood for us ain't been so good
Got no swimming pool, very few clothes ♪</i>

623
00:47:22,842 --> 00:47:26,762
<i>♪ All we earn are buttons and bows ♪</i>

624
00:47:29,807 --> 00:47:31,350
- Hello, Joe.
- Tom.

625
00:47:31,434 --> 00:47:32,810
How are you, Joe?

626
00:47:32,893 --> 00:47:34,895
- Welcome to the party.
- Hi, Joe.

627
00:47:36,647 --> 00:47:39,567
- Well, what do you know! Joe Gillis!
- Hiya, Artie.

628
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:41,444
Where you been keeping
that gorgeous face of yours?

629
00:47:41,527 --> 00:47:42,570
In a deep freeze.

630
00:47:42,653 --> 00:47:45,031
I almost reported you
to the Bureau of Missing Persons.

631
00:47:45,114 --> 00:47:48,117
Fans, you all know Joe Gillis,
the well-known screenwriter,

632
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,703
uranium smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect.

633
00:47:52,621 --> 00:47:54,915
- Come on, give me your coat.
- Let it ride for a while.

634
00:47:54,999 --> 00:47:57,418
- You're gonna stay, aren't you?
- Well, that was the general idea.

635
00:47:57,501 --> 00:48:01,005
Then, come on. What is this, mink?

636
00:48:03,257 --> 00:48:05,801
Judas H. Priest!

637
00:48:05,885 --> 00:48:08,387
Who did you borrow that from?
Adolphe Menjou?

638
00:48:08,471 --> 00:48:09,638
Close, but no cigar.

639
00:48:09,722 --> 00:48:11,974
Say, you're not really in the smuggling
business these days, are you?

640
00:48:12,058 --> 00:48:14,143
- Where's the bar?
- Come on.

641
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,106
- It's a good party.
- The greatest.

642
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:21,942
They call me the Elsa Maxwell
of the assistant directors.

643
00:48:22,026 --> 00:48:24,904
Hey, wait a minute.
Go easy on that punch bowl.

644
00:48:24,987 --> 00:48:28,324
Budget only calls for
three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.

645
00:48:28,407 --> 00:48:30,534
Say, Artie,
can I stick around here for a while?

646
00:48:30,618 --> 00:48:32,203
Sure. This will go on all night.

647
00:48:32,286 --> 00:48:34,413
No, I mean, can you put me up
for a couple of weeks?

648
00:48:34,497 --> 00:48:36,624
It just so happens
we have a vacancy on the couch.

649
00:48:36,707 --> 00:48:37,750
I'll take it.

650
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:39,376
I'll have the bellhop
take care of your luggage.

651
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:41,629
Just register it here.

652
00:48:44,465 --> 00:48:46,342
- Hello, Mr. Gillis.
- Hello.

653
00:48:46,467 --> 00:48:48,427
- You know each other?
- Let me help you.

654
00:48:48,511 --> 00:48:52,431
- Betty Schaefer, Sheldrake's office.
- Oh, sure. <i>Bases Loaded.</i>

655
00:48:52,515 --> 00:48:56,435
Wait a minute. This is the woman I love.
What's going on? Who was loaded?

656
00:48:56,519 --> 00:48:59,021
Don't worry.
She's just a fan for my literary output.

657
00:48:59,105 --> 00:49:00,314
Hurt Feelings Department.

658
00:49:00,397 --> 00:49:01,857
Hey, about that luggage. Where's the phone?

659
00:49:01,941 --> 00:49:03,984
Over by the Rainbow Room.

660
00:49:13,744 --> 00:49:17,331
Say, when you're through with
that thing, can I have it?

661
00:49:20,668 --> 00:49:22,503
Hey, you forgot this.

662
00:49:22,586 --> 00:49:26,340
- Thanks.
- I've been hoping to run into you.

663
00:49:26,423 --> 00:49:29,176
What for? To recover that knife
you stuck in my back?

664
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:32,471
No. I felt a little guilty,
so I got out some of your old stories.

665
00:49:32,555 --> 00:49:33,681
Why, you sweet kid.

666
00:49:33,764 --> 00:49:36,976
There's one called <i>Window,</i>
something with a window.

667
00:49:37,059 --> 00:49:39,145
- <i>Dark Windows.</i> How'd you like it?
- I didn't.

668
00:49:39,228 --> 00:49:41,772
- Thank you.
- Except for about six pages.

669
00:49:41,856 --> 00:49:44,775
You've got a flashback there...

670
00:49:44,859 --> 00:49:48,737
- Is there someplace we can talk?
- How about the Rainbow Room?

671
00:49:51,157 --> 00:49:53,659
Hey, Joe. I said you could have my couch.

672
00:49:53,742 --> 00:49:57,580
- I didn't say you could have my girl.
- Oh, this is shop talk.

673
00:49:58,247 --> 00:50:00,791
Now, if I got you correctly,
there was a short stretch of my fiction

674
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:02,626
which you found worthy of notice.

675
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:04,003
The flashback scene in the courtroom

676
00:50:04,086 --> 00:50:05,796
when she tells about being a schoolteacher.

677
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,631
I had a teacher like that once.

678
00:50:07,715 --> 00:50:11,010
Maybe that's why it's good.
It's true. It's moving.

679
00:50:11,093 --> 00:50:13,929
- Now why don't you use that character...
- Who wants true? Who wants moving?

680
00:50:14,013 --> 00:50:16,557
Drop that attitude!
Here's something really worthwhile.

681
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,893
Want me to start right away?
Maybe there's some paper around.

682
00:50:18,976 --> 00:50:21,896
- I'm serious. I've got a few ideas.
- And I've got a few ideas of my own.

683
00:50:21,979 --> 00:50:23,480
One of them being this is New Year's Eve.

684
00:50:23,564 --> 00:50:24,857
How about living it up a little?

685
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:27,026
- As for instance?
- Well...

686
00:50:27,109 --> 00:50:29,445
We could make some paper boats
and have a regatta.

687
00:50:29,528 --> 00:50:31,155
Or we could turn on the shower full blast.

688
00:50:31,238 --> 00:50:33,616
How about capturing the kitchen
and barricading the door?

689
00:50:33,699 --> 00:50:36,535
- Are you hungry?
- Hungry?

690
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:40,915
After 12 years in the Burmese jungle,
I'm starving, Lady Agatha.

691
00:50:40,998 --> 00:50:44,919
- Starving for a white shoulder...
- Phillip, you're mad!

692
00:50:45,002 --> 00:50:47,379
Thirsting for the coolness of your lips.

693
00:50:49,632 --> 00:50:51,717
You can have the phone now.

694
00:50:53,344 --> 00:50:55,638
No, Phillip, no. We must be strong.

695
00:50:55,721 --> 00:50:58,057
You're still wearing the uniform
of the Coldstream Guards.

696
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:01,143
Furthermore, you can have the phone now.

697
00:51:01,227 --> 00:51:03,562
Okay.

698
00:51:03,646 --> 00:51:06,148
Suddenly I find myself
terribly afraid of losing you.

699
00:51:06,232 --> 00:51:09,860
You won't.
I'll get us a refill of this horrible liquid.

700
00:51:09,944 --> 00:51:13,822
- You'll be waiting for me?
- With a wildly beating heart.

701
00:51:14,156 --> 00:51:16,659
Life can be beautiful.

702
00:51:36,887 --> 00:51:40,182
Hello, Max. This is Mr. Gillis.
I want you to do me a favor.

703
00:51:40,432 --> 00:51:43,185
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis. I cannot talk now.

704
00:51:43,269 --> 00:51:45,771
Yes you can.
I want you to get my old suitcase

705
00:51:45,854 --> 00:51:48,274
and put in all my old clothes,
the ones I came with.

706
00:51:48,357 --> 00:51:50,526
And my typewriter.
I'll have somebody pick them up.

707
00:51:50,609 --> 00:51:54,613
I have no time to do anything now.
The doctor is here.

708
00:51:55,864 --> 00:51:57,992
What doctor? What's going on?

709
00:51:58,075 --> 00:52:01,370
Madame got the razor from your room
and she cut her wrists.

710
00:52:02,538 --> 00:52:05,374
What? Max! Max!

711
00:52:17,052 --> 00:52:20,347
I just got the recipe.
You take two packages of cough drops

712
00:52:20,431 --> 00:52:23,851
and dissolve in one gallon
of lukewarm grape juice, and...

713
00:52:30,524 --> 00:52:31,817
Hey, Joe!

714
00:52:40,242 --> 00:52:41,660
Happy New Year!

715
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:49,835
- How is she?
- She's up in her room.

716
00:52:49,918 --> 00:52:52,588
Be careful. Don't race upstairs.

717
00:52:52,671 --> 00:52:55,090
The musicians mustn't know what happened.

718
00:53:39,343 --> 00:53:40,719
Go away.

719
00:53:50,938 --> 00:53:53,273
What kind of a silly thing was that to do?

720
00:53:53,357 --> 00:53:56,777
To fall in love with you,
that was the idiotic thing.

721
00:53:58,612 --> 00:54:01,740
It sure would have made
attractive headlines.

722
00:54:01,824 --> 00:54:05,244
"Great Star Kills Herself
for Unknown Writer."

723
00:54:05,327 --> 00:54:07,996
Great stars have great pride.

724
00:54:14,002 --> 00:54:17,798
Go away. Go to that girl of yours.

725
00:54:22,803 --> 00:54:25,639
Look, I was making that up

726
00:54:25,722 --> 00:54:28,851
because I thought the whole thing
was a mistake.

727
00:54:29,852 --> 00:54:33,814
I didn't want to hurt you.
You've been good to me.

728
00:54:33,897 --> 00:54:37,776
You're the only person in this
stinking town that has been good to me.

729
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:41,363
Why don't you just
say thank you and go? Go, go!

730
00:54:41,447 --> 00:54:45,033
Not until you promise to act
like a sensible human being.

731
00:54:46,201 --> 00:54:48,829
I'll do it again. I'll do it again.

732
00:54:51,498 --> 00:54:53,167
I'll do it again.

733
00:55:45,677 --> 00:55:47,596
Happy New Year, Norma.

734
00:55:58,607 --> 00:56:00,859
Happy New Year, darling.

735
00:56:18,794 --> 00:56:19,878
Hello?

736
00:56:19,962 --> 00:56:23,549
Is this Crestview 5-1733?

737
00:56:23,632 --> 00:56:24,967
I'm sorry to bother you again,

738
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:28,387
but I've confirmed the number.
I must speak to Mr. Gillis.

739
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:31,640
- He's not here.
- Well, where can I reach him?

740
00:56:31,765 --> 00:56:33,517
Maybe somebody else in the house
could tell me...

741
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,770
Nobody here can give you any information.

742
00:56:36,853 --> 00:56:39,439
And you will please not call again!

743
00:56:41,817 --> 00:56:42,859
Max!

744
00:56:45,696 --> 00:56:47,906
Who was it, Max? What is it?

745
00:56:50,284 --> 00:56:54,496
Nothing, Madame.
Somebody inquiring about a stray dog.

746
00:56:55,581 --> 00:56:59,293
Our number must be very similar
to the number of the pound.

747
00:57:00,168 --> 00:57:02,879
Wait a minute.
I want you to get out the car.

748
00:57:02,963 --> 00:57:04,548
You're to take the script over to Paramount

749
00:57:04,631 --> 00:57:07,384
and deliver it to Mr. DeMille in person.

750
00:57:07,676 --> 00:57:09,344
Very good, Madame.

751
00:57:14,516 --> 00:57:16,184
You really going to send
that script to DeMille?

752
00:57:16,268 --> 00:57:19,855
Yes, I am. This is the day.
Here's the chart from my astrologer.

753
00:57:19,938 --> 00:57:21,607
She read DeMille's horoscope.
She read mine.

754
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:24,276
- Did she read the script?
- DeMille is Leo. I'm Scorpio.

755
00:57:24,359 --> 00:57:26,737
Mars has been transiting Jupiter for weeks.

756
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:30,449
Today is the day
of the greatest conjunction.

757
00:57:30,824 --> 00:57:33,452
Turn around, darling. Let me dry you.

758
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:39,916
I hope you realize, Norma, that
scripts don't sell on astrologer's charts.

759
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,294
I'm not just selling the script.
I'm selling me.

760
00:57:42,377 --> 00:57:45,213
DeMille always said
I was his greatest star.

761
00:57:45,297 --> 00:57:47,341
When did he say it, Norma?

762
00:57:48,091 --> 00:57:50,010
All right, it was quite a few years ago.

763
00:57:50,093 --> 00:57:53,221
But the point is,
I never looked better in my life.

764
00:57:53,388 --> 00:57:57,225
Do you know why? Because I've
never been as happy in my life.

765
00:58:01,897 --> 00:58:04,024
<i>A few evenings later,
we were going to the house</i>

766
00:58:04,107 --> 00:58:07,152
<i>of one of the waxworks for some bridge.</i>

767
00:58:07,235 --> 00:58:09,488
<i>She'd taught me how to play bridge by then,</i>

768
00:58:09,571 --> 00:58:12,574
<i>just as she'd taught me
some fancy tango steps</i>

769
00:58:13,033 --> 00:58:15,661
<i>and what wine to drink with what fish.</i>

770
00:58:18,246 --> 00:58:21,833
That idiot!
He forgot to fill my cigarette case.

771
00:58:21,917 --> 00:58:23,543
Here, have one of mine.

772
00:58:23,627 --> 00:58:25,921
They're dreadful. They make me cough.

773
00:58:29,424 --> 00:58:32,678
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max?
I'll get you some.

774
00:58:32,761 --> 00:58:34,596
You're a darling.

775
00:58:56,410 --> 00:59:00,539
Give me a package of those
Turkish cigarettes. Abdullas.

776
00:59:02,457 --> 00:59:06,253
Stick 'em up, Gillis!
Stick 'em up or I'll let you have it!

777
00:59:07,713 --> 00:59:09,589
Hi, Artie. Good evening, Miss Schaefer.

778
00:59:09,673 --> 00:59:11,466
You don't know how glad I am to see you!

779
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:13,844
Walking out on the mob.
What's the big idea?

780
00:59:13,927 --> 00:59:15,220
Oh, I'm sorry about New Year's.

781
00:59:15,303 --> 00:59:17,848
Would you believe me if I told you
I stayed with a sick friend?

782
00:59:17,931 --> 00:59:21,393
Someone in the formal set, no doubt,
with a 10-karat kidney stone.

783
00:59:21,476 --> 00:59:24,771
Oh, stop it, Artie, will you?
Where've you been keeping yourself?

784
00:59:24,855 --> 00:59:27,441
I've got the most wonderful news for you.

785
00:59:27,524 --> 00:59:30,110
I haven't been keeping myself at all.
Not lately.

786
00:59:30,193 --> 00:59:32,821
I called your agent.
I called the Screen Writers' Guild.

787
00:59:32,904 --> 00:59:35,407
Finally, your old apartment gave me
some Crestview number.

788
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:37,617
There was always somebody
with an accent growling at me.

789
00:59:37,701 --> 00:59:39,453
You were not there.
You were not to be spoken to.

790
00:59:39,536 --> 00:59:41,580
They never even heard of you.

791
00:59:41,663 --> 00:59:44,499
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?

792
00:59:44,583 --> 00:59:46,710
Sheldrake likes the angle
about the teacher.

793
00:59:46,793 --> 00:59:48,420
- What teacher?
<i>- Dark Windows.</i>

794
00:59:48,503 --> 00:59:50,005
I got him all hopped up about it.

795
00:59:50,088 --> 00:59:51,631
He thinks it could be made into something.

796
00:59:51,715 --> 00:59:54,509
- Okay. Where's the cash?
- Where's the story?

797
00:59:54,593 --> 00:59:56,303
I bluffed it out with a few notions
of my own.

798
00:59:56,386 --> 00:59:58,555
It's really just a springboard.
It needs work.

799
00:59:58,638 --> 00:59:59,723
I was afraid of that.

800
00:59:59,806 --> 01:00:02,934
I've got twenty pages of notes and I've
got a pretty good character for the man.

801
01:00:03,018 --> 01:00:04,519
Could you write in
plenty of background action

802
01:00:04,603 --> 01:00:06,104
so they'll need an extra
assistant director, huh?

803
01:00:06,188 --> 01:00:07,898
Oh, Artie, shut up!

804
01:00:08,231 --> 01:00:10,066
Now, if we could sit down for two weeks
to get a story...

805
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:12,903
I'm sorry, Miss Schaefer,
I've given up writing on spec.

806
01:00:12,986 --> 01:00:14,571
But I tell you this is half sold.

807
01:00:14,654 --> 01:00:16,948
As a matter of fact,
I've given up writing altogether.

808
01:00:17,032 --> 01:00:19,534
Mr. Gillis, if you please.

809
01:00:20,202 --> 01:00:22,037
I'll be right there.

810
01:00:22,913 --> 01:00:24,706
The accent! I get it!

811
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:26,541
This guy's in the pay
of a foreign government.

812
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:28,543
Check those studs. Get those cufflinks.

813
01:00:28,627 --> 01:00:31,755
I've got to run along. Thanks anyway
for your interest in my career.

814
01:00:31,838 --> 01:00:36,259
It's not your career, it's mine!
I'd kind of hoped to get in on this deal.

815
01:00:36,343 --> 01:00:39,471
I don't want to be a reader all my life.
I want to write.

816
01:00:39,554 --> 01:00:42,516
- I'm sorry if I crossed you up.
- You sure have!

817
01:00:42,974 --> 01:00:44,226
So long.

818
01:00:55,403 --> 01:00:57,697
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.

819
01:00:57,781 --> 01:00:59,699
Oh, I ran into some people I know.

820
01:00:59,783 --> 01:01:03,036
- Where are my cigarettes?
- Where are your...

821
01:01:04,871 --> 01:01:06,873
Norma, you're smoking too much.

822
01:01:10,335 --> 01:01:13,171
<i>Whenever she suspected I was getting bored,</i>

823
01:01:13,463 --> 01:01:15,966
<i>she would put on a live show for me.</i>

824
01:01:16,132 --> 01:01:18,552
<i>The Norma Desmond Follies.</i>

825
01:01:18,635 --> 01:01:22,264
<i>Her first number was always
the Mac Sennett Bathing Beauty.</i>

826
01:01:31,231 --> 01:01:35,944
I can still see myself in the line.
Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand.

827
01:01:36,236 --> 01:01:38,822
Mabel was always stepping on my feet.

828
01:01:38,905 --> 01:01:42,742
What's the matter with you, darling?
Why are you so glum?

829
01:01:42,826 --> 01:01:46,872
Nothing's the matter. I'm having
a great time. Show me some more.

830
01:01:46,955 --> 01:01:50,500
All right. Give me this.
I need it for a mustache.

831
01:01:50,584 --> 01:01:52,961
Now, close your eyes. Close them.

832
01:01:59,926 --> 01:02:02,679
<i>Something was the matter all right.</i>

833
01:02:02,762 --> 01:02:07,100
<i>I was thinking about that girl of Artie's,
that Miss Schaefer.</i>

834
01:02:07,684 --> 01:02:11,396
<i>She was so like all us writers
when we first hit Hollywood,</i>

835
01:02:11,479 --> 01:02:13,356
<i>itching with ambition,</i>

836
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:18,612
<i>planning to get your names up there.
"Screenplay by, Original Story by."</i>

837
01:02:22,032 --> 01:02:25,827
<i>Audiences don't know somebody
sits down and writes a picture.</i>

838
01:02:26,202 --> 01:02:29,414
<i>They think the actors make it up
as they go along.</i>

839
01:02:29,873 --> 01:02:31,416
Open your eyes.

840
01:03:06,034 --> 01:03:09,788
- Madame is wanted on the telephone.
- You know better than to interrupt me.

841
01:03:09,871 --> 01:03:11,873
- Paramount is calling.
- Who?

842
01:03:11,957 --> 01:03:13,667
Paramount Studios.

843
01:03:14,876 --> 01:03:18,880
Now! Now, do you believe me?
I told you DeMille would jump at it.

844
01:03:18,964 --> 01:03:21,132
It is not Mr. DeMille in person.

845
01:03:21,216 --> 01:03:23,301
It is someone by the name of Gordon Cole.

846
01:03:23,385 --> 01:03:26,262
- He says it's very important.
- Certainly it's important.

847
01:03:26,346 --> 01:03:28,723
It's important enough
for DeMille to call me personally.

848
01:03:28,807 --> 01:03:31,643
The very idea of having
some assistant call me!

849
01:03:31,726 --> 01:03:34,688
- Say I'm busy and hang up!
- Very good, Madame.

850
01:03:41,528 --> 01:03:43,238
How do you like that?

851
01:03:43,321 --> 01:03:47,325
We've made 12 pictures together,
his greatest successes!

852
01:03:47,409 --> 01:03:50,662
- Maybe he's busy, maybe he's shooting.
- I know that trick!

853
01:03:50,745 --> 01:03:54,332
He's trying to belittle me.
He's trying to get my price down.

854
01:03:54,416 --> 01:03:57,919
I've waited 20 years for this call.

855
01:03:58,003 --> 01:04:01,089
Now DeMille can wait
until I'm good and ready.

856
01:04:03,883 --> 01:04:07,303
<i>About three days later
she was good and ready.</i>

857
01:04:07,387 --> 01:04:09,180
<i>Incredible as it may seem,</i>

858
01:04:09,264 --> 01:04:13,059
<i>there'd been some more of those
urgent calls from Paramount.</i>

859
01:04:13,393 --> 01:04:17,647
<i>So, she put on about a half a pound
of makeup, fixed it up with a veil</i>

860
01:04:18,273 --> 01:04:21,067
<i>and set forth to see DeMille in person.</i>

861
01:04:23,445 --> 01:04:28,116
Madame will pardon me, the shadow
over the left eye is not quite balanced.

862
01:04:29,492 --> 01:04:31,077
Thank you, Max.

863
01:04:45,925 --> 01:04:47,844
Hold that noise!

864
01:04:49,179 --> 01:04:50,305
Hey!

865
01:04:50,805 --> 01:04:53,141
To see Mr. DeMille. Open the gate!

866
01:04:53,224 --> 01:04:55,727
Mr. DeMille is shooting.
You got an appointment?

867
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:59,397
No appointment necessary!
I'm bringing Norma Desmond.

868
01:04:59,731 --> 01:05:01,066
Norma who?

869
01:05:01,483 --> 01:05:04,235
Norma Desmond!

870
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:07,489
- Jonesy! Hey, Jonesy!
- Yeah?

871
01:05:08,323 --> 01:05:10,658
Why, if it isn't Miss Desmond.

872
01:05:11,659 --> 01:05:14,954
- How have you been, Miss Desmond?
- Open the gate!

873
01:05:15,038 --> 01:05:17,332
Sure, Miss Desmond. Come on, Mac.

874
01:05:17,415 --> 01:05:19,334
They can't drive on the lot without a pass.

875
01:05:19,417 --> 01:05:21,628
Miss Desmond can. Come on.

876
01:05:31,971 --> 01:05:34,599
- Where's Mr. DeMille shooting?
- Stage 18, Miss Desmond.

877
01:05:34,682 --> 01:05:38,103
Thank you, Jonesy,
and teach your friend some manners.

878
01:05:38,186 --> 01:05:40,105
Tell him without me,
he wouldn't have any job,

879
01:05:40,188 --> 01:05:42,190
because without me, there
wouldn't be any Paramount Studio.

880
01:05:42,273 --> 01:05:45,026
- You're right, Miss Desmond.
- Go on, Max.

881
01:05:53,993 --> 01:05:55,578
Stage 18.

882
01:05:56,412 --> 01:05:59,124
<i>Oh, I guess, get... Notify Henry Wilcoxon.</i>

883
01:05:59,207 --> 01:06:02,585
<i>Just clear them out, will you?
Spread the thing out so I can see it.</i>

884
01:06:05,547 --> 01:06:06,965
<i>Keep it quiet a little bit,
will you, back there?</i>

885
01:06:07,048 --> 01:06:09,968
Norma Desmond's coming in
to see Mr. DeMille.

886
01:06:10,051 --> 01:06:14,722
<i>Can you hit that with a light, somebody,
so I can get a look at that 'scape?</i>

887
01:06:14,806 --> 01:06:16,850
<i>Back up a little bit here, girlie, back up.</i>

888
01:06:16,933 --> 01:06:19,477
<i>Soldier, get out of the way.
You fell over the back there.</i>

889
01:06:19,561 --> 01:06:21,813
Norma Desmond's coming in
to see Mr. DeMille.

890
01:06:21,896 --> 01:06:23,731
Norma Desmond?

891
01:06:25,191 --> 01:06:26,192
Wait a minute.

892
01:06:26,276 --> 01:06:28,069
<i>- Harry Wilcoxon!</i>
- Yes?

893
01:06:28,153 --> 01:06:30,822
<i>Draw your sword
and raise that drape with it.</i>

894
01:06:30,905 --> 01:06:32,991
<i>Samson's lying unconscious over here.</i>

895
01:06:33,074 --> 01:06:36,202
Norma Desmond is coming in
to see you, Mr. DeMille.

896
01:06:36,911 --> 01:06:39,956
- Norma Desmond?
- She must be a million years old.

897
01:06:40,665 --> 01:06:44,335
I hate to think where that puts me.
I could be her father.

898
01:06:44,419 --> 01:06:45,503
Very sorry, Mr. DeMille.

899
01:06:45,587 --> 01:06:48,631
It must be about that awful script of hers.

900
01:06:49,757 --> 01:06:52,177
What can I tell her? What can I say?

901
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:54,345
I can tell her you're all tied up
in the projection room.

902
01:06:54,429 --> 01:06:56,681
I can give her the brush.

903
01:06:56,764 --> 01:07:00,185
Thirty million fans have given her
the brush. Isn't that enough?

904
01:07:00,268 --> 01:07:02,562
- I didn't mean to...
- No, of course you didn't.

905
01:07:02,645 --> 01:07:06,941
You didn't know Norma Desmond
as a lovely little girl of 17

906
01:07:07,025 --> 01:07:09,569
with more courage and wit and heart

907
01:07:09,652 --> 01:07:11,863
than ever came together in one youngster.

908
01:07:11,946 --> 01:07:14,115
I understand she was a terror to work with.

909
01:07:14,199 --> 01:07:16,367
Only toward the end.

910
01:07:16,451 --> 01:07:19,621
You know, a dozen press agents
working overtime

911
01:07:20,246 --> 01:07:23,958
can do terrible things to the human spirit.

912
01:07:25,084 --> 01:07:26,753
<i>Hold everything.</i>

913
01:07:32,926 --> 01:07:35,803
- Don't you want to come along, darling?
- I don't think so.

914
01:07:35,887 --> 01:07:37,722
It's your script. It's your show.
Good luck.

915
01:07:37,805 --> 01:07:39,307
Thank you, dearest.

916
01:07:43,102 --> 01:07:45,313
Well, hello, young fellow.

917
01:07:45,396 --> 01:07:48,399
- Hello, Mr. DeMille.
- It's good to see you.

918
01:07:48,483 --> 01:07:51,027
That last time I saw you
was some place very gay.

919
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:53,905
I remember waving to you.
I was dancing on a table.

920
01:07:53,988 --> 01:07:58,534
A lot of people were. Lindbergh had just
landed in Paris. Come on in.

921
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,956
Norma, I...

922
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:06,918
- I must apologize for not calling you.
- You'd better. I'm very angry.

923
01:08:07,001 --> 01:08:09,254
Well, as you can see, I'm terribly busy.

924
01:08:09,337 --> 01:08:12,548
That's no excuse.
You read the script, of course?

925
01:08:13,216 --> 01:08:14,259
Yes, I did.

926
01:08:14,342 --> 01:08:15,927
Then you could have
picked up the telephone yourself,

927
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:18,054
instead of leaving it
to one of your assistants.

928
01:08:18,137 --> 01:08:21,266
- What assistant?
- Now don't play innocent.

929
01:08:21,349 --> 01:08:25,561
- Somebody named Gordon Cole.
- Gordon Cole?

930
01:08:25,645 --> 01:08:28,273
And if you hadn't been pretty darned
interested in that script,

931
01:08:28,356 --> 01:08:31,109
he wouldn't have tried to get me
on the telephone 10 times.

932
01:08:31,192 --> 01:08:32,986
Gordon Cole!

933
01:08:34,153 --> 01:08:36,364
Norma, I'm in the middle of a rehearsal.

934
01:08:36,447 --> 01:08:38,825
Now, why don't you just sit
up here in my chair

935
01:08:38,908 --> 01:08:40,952
and make yourself comfortable?

936
01:08:41,035 --> 01:08:43,997
- Thank you.
- That's a girl. There.

937
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,165
I won't be a moment.

938
01:08:46,249 --> 01:08:49,085
Bring me a telephone
and get me Gordon Cole.

939
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:50,378
Right.

940
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:07,312
Hey, Miss Desmond!

941
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:14,110
Miss Desmond! It's me! It's Hog-Eye.

942
01:09:14,777 --> 01:09:16,738
Hello, Hog-Eye!

943
01:09:19,032 --> 01:09:21,451
Let's get a good look at you!

944
01:09:24,495 --> 01:09:28,708
- Look, there's Norma Desmond!
- Norma Desmond!

945
01:09:29,792 --> 01:09:32,253
- Norma Desmond.
- Why, I thought she was dead!

946
01:09:32,337 --> 01:09:34,005
How nice to see you.

947
01:09:34,088 --> 01:09:36,507
Welcome home, Miss Desmond.
You remember me, don't you?

948
01:09:36,591 --> 01:09:38,426
- Miss Desmond!
- Hello!

949
01:09:39,719 --> 01:09:41,929
Mr. Wilcoxon, have you met Miss Desmond?

950
01:09:42,013 --> 01:09:43,681
It's a great pleasure.

951
01:09:43,765 --> 01:09:46,225
Oh, Gordon. This is C.B. DeMille.

952
01:09:46,309 --> 01:09:48,353
Have you been calling Norma Desmond?

953
01:09:48,436 --> 01:09:49,896
Yes, Mr. DeMille.

954
01:09:49,979 --> 01:09:52,690
It's that car of hers,
an old Isotta-Fraschini.

955
01:09:52,774 --> 01:09:54,650
Her chauffeur drove it in
on the lot the other day.

956
01:09:54,734 --> 01:09:56,694
It looks just right for the Crosby picture.

957
01:09:56,778 --> 01:09:59,280
We want to rent it for a couple of weeks.

958
01:09:59,364 --> 01:10:00,782
Oh, I see.

959
01:10:02,325 --> 01:10:05,453
Well, thank you very much. Thank you.

960
01:10:20,718 --> 01:10:24,472
<i>Hog-Eye, turn that light
back where it belongs.</i>

961
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:40,405
Well, I...

962
01:10:40,947 --> 01:10:42,740
I got hold of Gordon Cole.

963
01:10:42,824 --> 01:10:45,451
Did you see them?
Did you see how they came?

964
01:10:45,535 --> 01:10:46,828
You know,

965
01:10:46,911 --> 01:10:50,456
some crazy things happen
in this business, Norma.

966
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:53,835
I hope you haven't lost
your sense of humor.

967
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:57,296
- What's the matter, dear?
- Nothing.

968
01:10:57,547 --> 01:11:01,634
I just didn't realize what it would be like
to come back to the old studio.

969
01:11:01,717 --> 01:11:04,178
I had no idea how much I'd missed it.

970
01:11:04,262 --> 01:11:05,555
We've missed you, too, dear.

971
01:11:05,638 --> 01:11:08,891
We'll be working again, won't we,
Chief? We'll make our greatest picture!

972
01:11:08,975 --> 01:11:12,687
- That's what I want to talk to you about.
- It's a good script, isn't it?

973
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:16,190
Well, it's...
It has some good things in it, yes, but,

974
01:11:16,899 --> 01:11:18,776
it would be a very expensive picture.

975
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:22,572
Oh, I don't care about the money.
I just want to work again.

976
01:11:22,697 --> 01:11:25,491
You don't know what it means
to know that you want me.

977
01:11:25,575 --> 01:11:28,536
Nothing would please me more, Norma, if...

978
01:11:28,703 --> 01:11:30,580
- If it were possible.
- And remember, darling,

979
01:11:30,663 --> 01:11:34,459
I don't work before 10:00 in the morning,
and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.

980
01:11:34,542 --> 01:11:36,461
We're ready for the shot, Mr. DeMille.

981
01:11:36,544 --> 01:11:40,840
All right. Norma, why don't you just
sit here and watch?

982
01:11:41,549 --> 01:11:44,635
You know,
pictures have changed quite a bit.

983
01:11:45,386 --> 01:11:47,472
All right, let's go!

984
01:11:47,847 --> 01:11:49,348
Hit 'em all!

985
01:11:51,476 --> 01:11:52,810
Roll 'em!

986
01:11:54,187 --> 01:11:55,396
Speed!

987
01:12:03,613 --> 01:12:06,491
You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis?

988
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:11,579
They used to be Madame's
dressing room. The whole row.

989
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:14,457
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.

990
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:17,168
Oh, he had a great big bungalow on wheels.

991
01:12:18,211 --> 01:12:20,129
I had the upstairs.

992
01:12:20,213 --> 01:12:23,174
You see where it says
"Readers' Department"?

993
01:12:23,716 --> 01:12:27,428
I remember my walls were covered
with black patent leather.

994
01:12:36,395 --> 01:12:38,731
I'll be with you in a minute.

995
01:12:51,077 --> 01:12:53,496
Hey, here's that funny car
Gordon Cole was talking about.

996
01:12:53,579 --> 01:12:55,831
- Yeah.
- Do you mind if we look it over?

997
01:12:55,915 --> 01:12:57,917
What's so funny about it?

998
01:13:04,924 --> 01:13:06,467
Just so you don't think
I'm a complete swine,

999
01:13:06,551 --> 01:13:09,887
if there's anything in <i>Dark Windows</i>
you can use, take it. It's all yours.

1000
01:13:09,971 --> 01:13:13,015
Well, for heaven's sakes!
Come on in, have a chair.

1001
01:13:13,099 --> 01:13:15,893
I mean it. It's no good to me, anyway.
Help yourself.

1002
01:13:15,977 --> 01:13:17,144
Now, why should you do that?

1003
01:13:17,228 --> 01:13:19,897
If you get 100,000 for it,
you buy me a box of chocolate creams.

1004
01:13:19,981 --> 01:13:21,691
If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.

1005
01:13:21,774 --> 01:13:23,693
You know,
I'd take you up on that in a minute.

1006
01:13:23,776 --> 01:13:26,070
I'm just not good enough
to do it all by myself.

1007
01:13:26,153 --> 01:13:27,863
What about all those ideas you had?

1008
01:13:27,947 --> 01:13:30,324
Well, see if they make sense.

1009
01:13:30,408 --> 01:13:33,327
To begin with, I think you should throw
out all that psychological mess,

1010
01:13:33,411 --> 01:13:37,206
- exploring a killer's sick mind.
- Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.

1011
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:40,751
This is a story about teachers,
their threadbare lives, their struggle!

1012
01:13:40,835 --> 01:13:44,005
Now, I see her teaching day classes
while he teaches night school.

1013
01:13:44,088 --> 01:13:46,007
Now, the first time they meet...

1014
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:48,467
Look, if you don't mind,
I haven't time to listen to the whole plot.

1015
01:13:48,551 --> 01:13:50,928
- I'll make it short.
- I'm sorry. It's your baby now.

1016
01:13:51,012 --> 01:13:53,889
Couldn't we work in the evenings?
6:00 in the morning?

1017
01:13:53,973 --> 01:13:57,602
This next month I'm completely
at your disposal. Artie's out of town.

1018
01:13:57,685 --> 01:14:00,813
- What's Artie got to do with it?
- We're engaged.

1019
01:14:01,272 --> 01:14:04,984
Oh. Oh, well, good for you.
You couldn't find a nicer guy.

1020
01:14:05,067 --> 01:14:09,322
That's what I think. They're on location
in Arizona, making a Western.

1021
01:14:09,405 --> 01:14:11,449
I'm free every evening and every weekend.

1022
01:14:11,532 --> 01:14:14,785
We could work at your place, if you want.

1023
01:14:14,869 --> 01:14:17,079
Look, Betty, it can't be done. It's out!

1024
01:14:17,163 --> 01:14:19,290
Now, stop being chicken-hearted
and write that story!

1025
01:14:19,373 --> 01:14:22,418
- Honest to goodness, I hate you!
- And don't make it too dreary.

1026
01:14:22,501 --> 01:14:23,794
How about this for a situation?

1027
01:14:23,878 --> 01:14:25,921
She teaches daytimes,
he teaches at night. Right?

1028
01:14:26,005 --> 01:14:27,298
- Right.
- They don't even know each other,

1029
01:14:27,381 --> 01:14:29,550
but they share the same room.
It's cheaper that way.

1030
01:14:29,634 --> 01:14:33,971
As a matter of fact, they sleep
in the same bed. In shifts, of course.

1031
01:14:35,056 --> 01:14:37,892
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.

1032
01:14:38,309 --> 01:14:39,644
- So do I.
- Well, come on back.

1033
01:14:39,727 --> 01:14:42,313
- Let me show you where it fits in.
- So long.

1034
01:14:42,396 --> 01:14:44,231
Oh, you...

1035
01:14:50,363 --> 01:14:52,406
- What's the matter, Max?
- I just found out the reason

1036
01:14:52,490 --> 01:14:55,076
for all those telephone calls
from Paramount.

1037
01:14:55,576 --> 01:14:59,497
It's not Madame they want.
It's her car they want to rent.

1038
01:14:59,705 --> 01:15:00,956
What?

1039
01:15:04,251 --> 01:15:07,505
Well, goodbye, Norma.
We'll see what we can do.

1040
01:15:07,588 --> 01:15:11,217
I'm not worried. Everything will be fine.
The old team together again.

1041
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:14,845
- Nothing can stop us.
- The old team. Yeah.

1042
01:15:16,889 --> 01:15:19,684
- Goodbye, dear.
- Goodbye, Mr. DeMille.

1043
01:15:28,526 --> 01:15:30,361
- How'd it go?
- It couldn't have gone better.

1044
01:15:30,444 --> 01:15:32,029
It's practically set.

1045
01:15:32,113 --> 01:15:36,867
Of course, he has to finish this picture
first, but mine will be his next.

1046
01:15:37,368 --> 01:15:41,914
Get Gordon Cole.
Tell him to forget about her car.

1047
01:15:41,997 --> 01:15:44,917
Tell him he can get
another old car someplace.

1048
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,837
I'll buy him five old cars, if necessary.

1049
01:15:54,969 --> 01:15:56,220
<i>After that,</i>

1050
01:15:56,303 --> 01:16:00,391
<i>an army of beauty experts invaded
her house on Sunset Boulevard.</i>

1051
01:16:01,308 --> 01:16:04,478
<i>She went through
a merciless series of treatments.</i>

1052
01:16:04,562 --> 01:16:08,566
<i>Like an athlete training for the Olympic
Games, she counted every calorie.</i>

1053
01:16:08,649 --> 01:16:11,026
<i>Went to bed every night at 9:00.</i>

1054
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:14,280
<i>She was absolutely determined to be ready,</i>

1055
01:16:14,655 --> 01:16:17,658
<i>ready for those cameras
that would never turn.</i>

1056
01:16:54,445 --> 01:16:56,947
- Joe, darling, are you there?
- Yes, Norma.

1057
01:16:57,031 --> 01:17:00,159
Don't turn around!
Keep your eyes on the book.

1058
01:17:02,536 --> 01:17:04,747
I just came to say good night.

1059
01:17:05,623 --> 01:17:06,624
I don't want you to see me.

1060
01:17:06,707 --> 01:17:09,668
- I'm not very attractive.
- Good night.

1061
01:17:09,752 --> 01:17:11,754
You know, I've lost half a pound
since Tuesday.

1062
01:17:11,837 --> 01:17:13,339
- Good!
- I was a little worried

1063
01:17:13,422 --> 01:17:14,965
about the line of my throat.

1064
01:17:15,049 --> 01:17:17,551
- This woman has done wonders with it.
- Good.

1065
01:17:19,386 --> 01:17:23,224
- You'd better get to bed yourself.
- I think I'll read a little longer.

1066
01:17:25,059 --> 01:17:28,020
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?

1067
01:17:28,103 --> 01:17:30,648
- Why do you say that?
- I just happen to know it.

1068
01:17:30,731 --> 01:17:32,316
I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.

1069
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:35,319
You weren't here. Where were you?

1070
01:17:35,402 --> 01:17:38,697
- I went for a walk.
- No, you didn't. You took the car.

1071
01:17:40,282 --> 01:17:42,827
All right, I drove to the beach.

1072
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:45,496
Norma, you don't want me to feel
that I'm locked up in this house?

1073
01:17:45,579 --> 01:17:49,667
Of course not, Joe.
It's just that I don't want to be left alone.

1074
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:54,129
Not while I'm under this terrible strain.
My nerves are being torn to shreds.

1075
01:17:54,213 --> 01:17:58,592
All I ask is for you to be a little patient
and a little kind.

1076
01:18:00,386 --> 01:18:04,014
- Norma, I haven't done anything.
- Of course you haven't.

1077
01:18:04,974 --> 01:18:08,519
I wouldn't let you. Good night, darling.

1078
01:18:37,798 --> 01:18:41,635
<i>Yes, I was playing hooky
every evening alone in there.</i>

1079
01:18:43,137 --> 01:18:44,847
<i>It made me think of when I was 12</i>

1080
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:48,726
<i>and used to sneak out on the folks
to see a gangster picture.</i>

1081
01:18:49,143 --> 01:18:53,772
<i>This time, it wasn't to see a picture.
It was to try and write one.</i>

1082
01:18:54,481 --> 01:18:56,567
<i>That story of mine
Betty Schaefer had dug up</i>

1083
01:18:56,650 --> 01:19:00,321
<i>kept going through my head
like a dozen locomotives.</i>

1084
01:19:01,071 --> 01:19:03,991
<i>So, we started working on it,
the two of us,</i>

1085
01:19:04,116 --> 01:19:09,038
<i>nights when the studio was deserted,
up in her little cubbyhole of an office.</i>

1086
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:28,057
I got the funniest letter from Artie.

1087
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:31,101
It's rained every day since
they got to Arizona.

1088
01:19:31,185 --> 01:19:34,897
They rewrote the whole picture for rain
and shot half of it.

1089
01:19:35,731 --> 01:19:38,943
Now, the sun is out.
Nobody knows when they'll get back.

1090
01:19:39,026 --> 01:19:40,611
- Good.
- What's good about it?

1091
01:19:40,694 --> 01:19:43,113
I miss him something fierce.

1092
01:19:43,197 --> 01:19:44,949
I mean this is good dialog along in here.

1093
01:19:45,032 --> 01:19:46,742
- It'll play.
- It will?

1094
01:19:46,825 --> 01:19:50,788
Sure. Especially with lots of music
underneath, drowning it out.

1095
01:19:51,246 --> 01:19:54,291
- Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
- Constantly.

1096
01:19:55,793 --> 01:20:00,130
No, in all seriousness, this is really
good. It's fun writing with you.

1097
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:03,050
Oh, thanks.

1098
01:20:16,730 --> 01:20:18,232
Who's Norma?

1099
01:20:20,067 --> 01:20:21,568
Who's who?

1100
01:20:21,652 --> 01:20:24,947
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't usually read
private cigarette cases.

1101
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:27,908
Oh, that. It's from a friend of mine,

1102
01:20:29,368 --> 01:20:32,997
a middle-aged lady,
very foolish and very generous.

1103
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:35,332
I'll say. This is solid gold.

1104
01:20:35,416 --> 01:20:37,918
I gave her some advice
on an idiotic script.

1105
01:20:38,002 --> 01:20:40,087
Oh, the old, familiar story.

1106
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:42,756
You help a timid little soul
cross a crowded street.

1107
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:47,094
She turns out to be a multi-millionaire
and leaves you all her money.

1108
01:20:47,511 --> 01:20:50,889
That's the trouble with you readers.
You know all the plots.

1109
01:20:50,973 --> 01:20:54,226
Now, suppose you proofread
page 10 while the water boils.

1110
01:20:54,309 --> 01:20:56,270
- Okay?
- Okay.

1111
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:23,047
<i>Sometimes, when we got stuck,</i>

1112
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:25,966
<i>we'd make a little tour
of the drowsing lot,</i>

1113
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:28,260
<i>not talking much,</i>

1114
01:21:28,343 --> 01:21:31,972
<i>just wandering down alleys
between the sound stages</i>

1115
01:21:32,056 --> 01:21:35,976
<i>or through the sets they were getting
ready for the next day's shooting.</i>

1116
01:21:36,351 --> 01:21:38,103
<i>As a matter of fact,</i>

1117
01:21:38,187 --> 01:21:41,899
<i>it was on one of those walks
when she first told me about her nose.</i>

1118
01:21:41,982 --> 01:21:43,776
Look at this street.

1119
01:21:43,859 --> 01:21:48,238
All cardboard, all hollow, all phony,
all clone with mirrors.

1120
01:21:48,655 --> 01:21:52,201
You know, I like it better
than any street in the world.

1121
01:21:52,826 --> 01:21:56,080
Maybe because I used to play here
when I was a kid.

1122
01:21:56,997 --> 01:21:59,333
What were you, a child actress?

1123
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:04,213
No, I was born just two blocks from this
studio. Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.

1124
01:22:04,296 --> 01:22:06,715
My father was head electrician here
till he died.

1125
01:22:06,799 --> 01:22:09,802
- Mother still works in Wardrobe.
- Second generation, huh?

1126
01:22:09,885 --> 01:22:12,596
Third. Grandma did stunt work
for Pearl White.

1127
01:22:12,679 --> 01:22:14,306
I come from a picture family.

1128
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:17,142
Naturally, they expected me
to become a great star.

1129
01:22:17,226 --> 01:22:21,438
So I had 10 years of dramatic lessons,
diction, dancing.

1130
01:22:21,522 --> 01:22:25,400
Then the studio made a test.
Well, they didn't like my nose.

1131
01:22:25,692 --> 01:22:29,279
It slanted this way a little.
So, I went to a doctor and had it fixed.

1132
01:22:29,363 --> 01:22:32,032
They made more tests
and they were crazy about my nose,

1133
01:22:32,116 --> 01:22:34,952
only they didn't like my acting.

1134
01:22:37,621 --> 01:22:39,039
- Nice job.
- It should be.

1135
01:22:39,123 --> 01:22:41,458
It cost me $300.

1136
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:44,294
- That's the saddest thing I ever heard.
- Oh, not at all.

1137
01:22:44,378 --> 01:22:46,755
It taught me a little sense.
I got a job in the mailroom,

1138
01:22:46,839 --> 01:22:49,049
worked up to the Stenographic.
Now I'm a reader.

1139
01:22:49,133 --> 01:22:50,134
Come clean, Betty.

1140
01:22:50,217 --> 01:22:53,387
At night you weep for those lost
close-ups, those gala openings.

1141
01:22:53,470 --> 01:22:54,513
Not once.

1142
01:22:54,596 --> 01:22:57,474
What's wrong with being on the
other side of the cameras?

1143
01:22:57,558 --> 01:23:01,353
- It's really more fun.
- Three cheers for Betty Schaefer!

1144
01:23:01,728 --> 01:23:05,023
- I will now kiss that nose of yours.
- If you please.

1145
01:23:09,653 --> 01:23:13,949
- May I say that you smell real special?
- It must be my new shampoo.

1146
01:23:15,659 --> 01:23:20,914
That's no shampoo. It's more like
freshly laundered linen handkerchiefs.

1147
01:23:21,915 --> 01:23:25,043
Like a brand-new automobile.

1148
01:23:25,127 --> 01:23:27,796
- How old are you, anyway?
- Twenty-two.

1149
01:23:29,089 --> 01:23:32,593
Smart girl. Nothing like being twenty-two.

1150
01:23:34,469 --> 01:23:37,139
And may I suggest that
if we're ever to finish this story,

1151
01:23:37,222 --> 01:23:40,017
you stay at least two feet away from me.

1152
01:23:40,809 --> 01:23:42,519
The first time you see me
coming any closer,

1153
01:23:42,603 --> 01:23:46,523
I want you to take off a shoe
and clunk me on the head with it.

1154
01:23:47,441 --> 01:23:51,361
Now back to the typewriters,
by way of Washington Square.

1155
01:24:37,824 --> 01:24:40,244
What is it, Max?

1156
01:24:40,327 --> 01:24:42,704
Want to wash the car,

1157
01:24:42,788 --> 01:24:45,916
or are you doing a little spying
in your off hours?

1158
01:24:45,999 --> 01:24:49,336
You must be very careful
as you cross the patio.

1159
01:24:49,419 --> 01:24:50,921
Madame may be watching.

1160
01:24:51,004 --> 01:24:53,257
How about going up the kitchen stairs
and undressing in the dark?

1161
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:55,259
Will that do it?

1162
01:24:55,342 --> 01:24:58,428
I am not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes
every night.

1163
01:24:58,512 --> 01:25:01,515
Why don't you? I'm writing a script.

1164
01:25:01,848 --> 01:25:04,268
And I'm going to finish it, no matter what.

1165
01:25:04,351 --> 01:25:07,562
It is just that I am greatly worried
about Madame.

1166
01:25:08,855 --> 01:25:10,357
Sure you are.

1167
01:25:10,857 --> 01:25:14,987
And we're not helping her any,
feeding her lies and more lies.

1168
01:25:15,362 --> 01:25:19,366
Getting herself ready for a picture.
What happens when she finds out?

1169
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:23,537
She never will. That is my job,

1170
01:25:23,912 --> 01:25:26,957
and it has been for a long time.

1171
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:31,295
You must understand,
I discovered her when she was 16.

1172
01:25:31,712 --> 01:25:36,508
I made her a star,
and I cannot let her be destroyed.

1173
01:25:37,426 --> 01:25:42,556
- You made her a star.
- Yes, I directed all her early films.

1174
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:47,811
There were three young directors
who showed promise in those days.

1175
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:53,608
D.W. Griffith, Cecil B. DeMille
and Max von Mayerling.

1176
01:25:55,527 --> 01:25:57,779
And she's turned you into a servant.

1177
01:25:57,863 --> 01:26:02,242
It was I who asked to come back,
humiliating as it may seem.

1178
01:26:02,326 --> 01:26:05,203
I could have continued my career,

1179
01:26:05,287 --> 01:26:10,083
only I found everything unendurable
after she had left me.

1180
01:26:10,584 --> 01:26:11,877
You see,

1181
01:26:13,253 --> 01:26:15,422
I was her first husband.

1182
01:26:42,616 --> 01:26:44,076
You're here, Joe!

1183
01:26:46,036 --> 01:26:47,954
When did you come home?

1184
01:26:52,459 --> 01:26:55,170
Oh, Joe, where were you?

1185
01:26:56,671 --> 01:26:59,383
Is it a woman? I know it's a woman.
Who is she?

1186
01:27:00,133 --> 01:27:03,804
Why can't I ask you? I must know!

1187
01:27:58,775 --> 01:28:00,527
What's the matter?

1188
01:28:03,405 --> 01:28:06,825
Betty, wake up!
Why are you staring at me like that?

1189
01:28:08,702 --> 01:28:10,537
Oh, was I? I'm sorry.

1190
01:28:11,913 --> 01:28:15,417
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it?

1191
01:28:16,293 --> 01:28:19,004
Oh, something came up.
I don't want to talk about it.

1192
01:28:19,087 --> 01:28:20,464
Why not?

1193
01:28:27,888 --> 01:28:29,389
I just don't.

1194
01:28:37,898 --> 01:28:39,608
What've you heard?

1195
01:28:40,358 --> 01:28:43,862
Come on, let's have it. Is it about me?

1196
01:28:58,084 --> 01:29:02,422
Betty, there's no use running out on it.
Let's face it, whatever it is.

1197
01:29:03,465 --> 01:29:09,095
- I got a telegram from Artie.
- From Artie? What's wrong?

1198
01:29:09,971 --> 01:29:12,474
He wants me to come on to Arizona.

1199
01:29:13,141 --> 01:29:16,686
He says it only costs $2
to get married there.

1200
01:29:18,021 --> 01:29:20,565
It would kind of save us a honeymoon.

1201
01:29:21,024 --> 01:29:24,653
Well, why don't you?
We can finish the script by Thursday.

1202
01:29:26,947 --> 01:29:30,283
Stop crying, will you? You're getting
married. That's what you wanted.

1203
01:29:30,367 --> 01:29:32,118
I don't want it now.

1204
01:29:33,662 --> 01:29:38,208
- Why not? Don't you love Artie?
- Of course I love him. I always will.

1205
01:29:40,627 --> 01:29:44,297
I'm not in love with him anymore,
that's all.

1206
01:29:45,882 --> 01:29:49,928
- What happened?
- You did.

1207
01:30:03,858 --> 01:30:06,987
<i>It wasn't until I got back to that
peculiar prison of mine</i>

1208
01:30:07,070 --> 01:30:09,447
<i>that I started facing the facts.</i>

1209
01:30:11,491 --> 01:30:16,288
<i>There it was, Betty Schaefer's future
right in the palm of my hand.</i>

1210
01:30:17,414 --> 01:30:21,710
<i>Betty Schaefer engaged to Artie Green,
as nice a guy as ever lived.</i>

1211
01:30:22,836 --> 01:30:26,298
<i>And she was in love with me. Me!</i>

1212
01:30:39,185 --> 01:30:43,565
<i>She was a fool not to sense that there
was something phony in my setup.</i>

1213
01:30:43,648 --> 01:30:46,735
<i>And I was a heel not to have told her.</i>

1214
01:30:46,818 --> 01:30:51,197
<i>But you just can't say those things
to somebody you're crazy about.</i>

1215
01:30:52,157 --> 01:30:55,619
<i>Maybe I'd never have to.
Maybe I could get away with it,</i>

1216
01:30:55,702 --> 01:30:57,329
<i>get away from Norma.</i>

1217
01:30:57,412 --> 01:31:01,207
<i>Maybe I could wipe the whole
nasty mess right out of my life.</i>

1218
01:31:10,091 --> 01:31:13,803
Hello. Is this Gladstone 9281?

1219
01:31:13,887 --> 01:31:18,058
May I speak to Miss Betty Schaefer?
She must be home by now.

1220
01:31:18,558 --> 01:31:22,896
Hey, Betty! Here's that weird-sounding
woman again.

1221
01:31:24,064 --> 01:31:26,399
Well, what is this, anyway?

1222
01:31:27,442 --> 01:31:29,569
This is Betty Schaefer.

1223
01:31:29,653 --> 01:31:33,782
You must forgive me for calling you
so late, but I really feel it's my duty.

1224
01:31:34,115 --> 01:31:37,577
It's about Mr. Gillis.
You do know Mr. Gillis?

1225
01:31:39,204 --> 01:31:42,248
Exactly how much do you know about him?

1226
01:31:43,333 --> 01:31:45,502
Do you know where he lives?

1227
01:31:46,086 --> 01:31:49,589
Do you know how he lives?
Do you know what he lives on?

1228
01:31:50,757 --> 01:31:54,928
Who are you? What do you want?
What business is it of yours, anyway?

1229
01:31:55,136 --> 01:31:58,848
Miss Schaefer,
I'm trying to do you a favor.

1230
01:31:59,349 --> 01:32:03,019
I'm trying to spare you
a great deal of misery.

1231
01:32:03,103 --> 01:32:07,607
Of course you may be too young to even
suspect there are men of his sort.

1232
01:32:08,108 --> 01:32:11,903
I don't know what he's told you,
but he does not live with relatives,

1233
01:32:12,153 --> 01:32:15,740
nor with friends
in the usual sense of the word.

1234
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:19,744
Well, ask him. Ask him again.

1235
01:32:24,874 --> 01:32:28,128
That's right, Betty, ask me again.
This is Joe.

1236
01:32:28,753 --> 01:32:32,799
Joe? Where are you? What is this all about?

1237
01:32:34,884 --> 01:32:38,555
Or better yet, why don't you come out
and see for yourself?

1238
01:32:38,638 --> 01:32:43,059
The address is 10,086 Sunset Boulevard.

1239
01:32:58,116 --> 01:33:01,995
Don't hate me, Joe!
I did it because I need you.

1240
01:33:02,078 --> 01:33:04,956
I need you as I've never needed you before.

1241
01:33:05,039 --> 01:33:07,834
Look at me! Look at my hands!

1242
01:33:07,917 --> 01:33:11,171
Look at my face! Look under my eyes!

1243
01:33:11,254 --> 01:33:14,549
How can I go back to work
if I'm wasting away under this torment?

1244
01:33:14,632 --> 01:33:17,677
You don't know what I've been through
these last weeks!

1245
01:33:25,268 --> 01:33:27,312
I bought myself a revolver, I did. I did!

1246
01:33:27,395 --> 01:33:31,274
I stood in front of that mirror,
but I couldn't make myself do it.

1247
01:33:31,357 --> 01:33:34,486
Don't just stand there hating me!
Shout at me!

1248
01:33:34,569 --> 01:33:40,366
Strike me! But don't hate me.
Say you don't hate me, Joe!

1249
01:33:55,215 --> 01:33:59,177
Here's 10,079, Connie.
It must be over there.

1250
01:34:09,062 --> 01:34:11,731
Betty, let me come along with you. Please!

1251
01:34:11,815 --> 01:34:13,733
No, I'll be all right.

1252
01:34:20,657 --> 01:34:24,786
I love you, Joe. I love you, Joe.

1253
01:34:25,662 --> 01:34:28,081
I love you, Joe.

1254
01:34:31,376 --> 01:34:34,921
What are you going to do, Joe?
What are you going to do?

1255
01:34:42,846 --> 01:34:45,557
It's all right, Max. I'll take it.

1256
01:34:45,932 --> 01:34:48,810
- Hello, Betty.
- I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.

1257
01:34:48,893 --> 01:34:51,271
- Is it something awful?
- Come on in.

1258
01:34:57,944 --> 01:35:01,239
Ever been in one of these
old Hollywood palazzos?

1259
01:35:01,322 --> 01:35:05,118
That's from when they were making
18,000 a week and no taxes.

1260
01:35:05,201 --> 01:35:09,539
Careful of these tiles, they're slippery.
Valentino used to dance here.

1261
01:35:09,789 --> 01:35:12,083
- This is where you live?
- You bet.

1262
01:35:13,710 --> 01:35:15,753
- Whose house is it?
- Hers.

1263
01:35:17,088 --> 01:35:18,590
- Whose?
- Just look around.

1264
01:35:18,673 --> 01:35:20,341
There's a lot of her spread about.

1265
01:35:20,425 --> 01:35:23,219
If you don't remember the face,
you must have heard the name.

1266
01:35:23,303 --> 01:35:24,929
Norma Desmond.

1267
01:35:26,222 --> 01:35:27,640
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?

1268
01:35:27,724 --> 01:35:30,143
Would you like something to drink?
There's always champagne on ice,

1269
01:35:30,226 --> 01:35:32,979
- plenty of caviar.
- Why did she call me?

1270
01:35:33,521 --> 01:35:34,856
Jealous.

1271
01:35:36,149 --> 01:35:37,734
Did you ever see so much junk?

1272
01:35:37,817 --> 01:35:40,445
She had the ceiling brought from Portugal.

1273
01:35:40,528 --> 01:35:42,322
And look at this.

1274
01:35:44,991 --> 01:35:46,951
Her own movie theater.

1275
01:35:47,368 --> 01:35:51,122
I didn't come here to see a house!
What about Norma Desmond?

1276
01:35:52,749 --> 01:35:57,003
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
This is an enormous place.

1277
01:35:57,670 --> 01:36:02,050
Eight master bedrooms.
A sunken tub in every bathroom.

1278
01:36:02,550 --> 01:36:05,219
There's a bowling alley in the cellar.

1279
01:36:07,764 --> 01:36:10,934
It's lonely here,
so she got herself a companion.

1280
01:36:12,310 --> 01:36:16,272
A very simple setup.
An older woman who is well-to-do.

1281
01:36:18,232 --> 01:36:21,986
A younger man who's not doing too well.

1282
01:36:22,070 --> 01:36:24,697
- Can you figure it out yourself?
- No.

1283
01:36:25,239 --> 01:36:30,370
- All right. I'll give you a few more clues.
- No! I haven't heard any of this.

1284
01:36:31,162 --> 01:36:35,500
I never got those telephone calls
and I've never been in this house!

1285
01:36:35,583 --> 01:36:38,878
Now, get your things together
and let's get out of here.

1286
01:36:39,837 --> 01:36:44,384
All my things? All my 18 suits,
all my custom-made shoes

1287
01:36:44,509 --> 01:36:46,260
and the six dozen shirts and the cufflinks

1288
01:36:46,344 --> 01:36:49,722
and the platinum key chains
and the cigarette cases?

1289
01:36:50,473 --> 01:36:51,933
Come on, Joe.

1290
01:36:53,101 --> 01:36:57,105
Come on where? Back to a one-room
apartment I can't pay for?

1291
01:36:57,563 --> 01:37:00,775
Back to a story that may sell
and very possibly will not?

1292
01:37:00,858 --> 01:37:02,735
If you love me, Joe.

1293
01:37:03,778 --> 01:37:07,240
Look, sweetie, be practical.
I've got a good deal here.

1294
01:37:07,407 --> 01:37:11,077
A long-term contract with no options.
I like it that way.

1295
01:37:12,620 --> 01:37:16,207
Maybe it's not very admirable.

1296
01:37:17,291 --> 01:37:20,670
Well, you and Artie can be admirable.

1297
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:26,551
I can't look at you anymore, Joe.

1298
01:37:30,430 --> 01:37:34,267
How about looking for the exit?
This way, Betty.

1299
01:37:50,199 --> 01:37:54,912
Good luck to you, Betty. You can finish
that script on the way to Arizona.

1300
01:37:57,123 --> 01:37:58,374
When you and Artie get back,

1301
01:37:58,458 --> 01:38:01,669
if the two of you
ever feel like taking a swim,

1302
01:38:02,795 --> 01:38:04,380
here's the pool.

1303
01:38:49,133 --> 01:38:51,844
Thank you, darling. Thank you, Joe.

1304
01:38:54,013 --> 01:38:55,181
Joe!

1305
01:39:20,623 --> 01:39:24,043
May I come in, Joe? I've stopped crying.

1306
01:39:24,418 --> 01:39:28,131
I'm all right again.
Joe, tell me you're not cross.

1307
01:39:28,339 --> 01:39:31,217
Tell me everything is just as it was, Joe.

1308
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:35,555
Joe!

1309
01:39:39,183 --> 01:39:41,227
What are you doing, Joe?

1310
01:39:47,191 --> 01:39:49,735
- What are you doing?
- I'm packing.

1311
01:39:53,239 --> 01:39:55,867
- You're leaving me!
- Yes, I am, Norma.

1312
01:39:56,909 --> 01:39:59,662
No, you're not! Max! Max!

1313
01:40:00,746 --> 01:40:03,166
Thanks for letting me
wear the handsome wardrobe.

1314
01:40:03,249 --> 01:40:06,294
And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.

1315
01:40:08,921 --> 01:40:10,339
The rest of the jewelry
is in the top drawer.

1316
01:40:10,423 --> 01:40:13,342
- It's yours, Joe. I gave it to you.
- And I'd take it in a second,

1317
01:40:13,426 --> 01:40:17,138
only it's a little too dressy for sitting
behind a copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.

1318
01:40:17,221 --> 01:40:19,557
These are nothing!
You can have anything you want.

1319
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:23,644
What is it you want? Money?

1320
01:40:24,770 --> 01:40:29,066
Norma, you'd be throwing it away.
I don't qualify for the job, not anymore.

1321
01:40:29,150 --> 01:40:34,280
You can't go! Max! Max!
I can't face life without you.

1322
01:40:36,782 --> 01:40:39,118
And you know I'm not afraid to die!

1323
01:40:39,202 --> 01:40:40,953
That's between you and yourself.

1324
01:40:41,037 --> 01:40:44,874
You think I made that up about the gun,
don't you? All right.

1325
01:40:54,008 --> 01:40:56,761
See, you didn't believe me!

1326
01:40:56,844 --> 01:40:58,554
Now, I suppose
you don't think I have the courage!

1327
01:40:58,638 --> 01:41:00,389
Oh, sure, if it would make a good scene.

1328
01:41:00,473 --> 01:41:01,599
You don't care, do you?

1329
01:41:01,682 --> 01:41:03,726
Well, hundreds of thousands
of people will care.

1330
01:41:03,809 --> 01:41:06,437
Oh, wake up, Norma. You'd be killing
yourself to an empty house.

1331
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:08,231
The audience left 20 years ago.
Now, face it!

1332
01:41:08,314 --> 01:41:11,400
- That's a lie! They still want me.
- No, they don't!

1333
01:41:12,235 --> 01:41:13,653
What about the studio? What about DeMille?

1334
01:41:13,736 --> 01:41:17,990
He was trying to spare your feelings.
The studio only wanted to rent your car.

1335
01:41:18,115 --> 01:41:20,701
- Wanted what?
- DeMille didn't have the heart to tell you.

1336
01:41:20,785 --> 01:41:22,578
None of us has had the heart.

1337
01:41:22,662 --> 01:41:26,624
That's a lie! They want me.
I get letters every day.

1338
01:41:28,417 --> 01:41:31,671
You tell her, Max.
Come on, do her that favor!

1339
01:41:31,754 --> 01:41:33,506
Tell her
there isn't going to be any picture!

1340
01:41:33,589 --> 01:41:36,384
There aren't any fan letters
except the ones you write!

1341
01:41:36,467 --> 01:41:39,887
That isn't true! Max!

1342
01:41:39,971 --> 01:41:42,723
Madame is the greatest star of them all.

1343
01:41:43,933 --> 01:41:47,019
I will take Mr. Gillis' bags to the car.

1344
01:41:53,317 --> 01:41:56,696
You heard him. I'm a star!

1345
01:41:57,697 --> 01:42:00,574
Norma, you're a woman of 50. Now, grow up!

1346
01:42:00,658 --> 01:42:05,371
There's nothing tragic about being 50,
not unless you try to be 25.

1347
01:42:05,454 --> 01:42:07,873
I'm the greatest star of them all.

1348
01:42:14,255 --> 01:42:15,840
Goodbye, Norma.

1349
01:42:18,217 --> 01:42:22,596
No one ever leaves a star.
That's what makes one a star.

1350
01:42:29,854 --> 01:42:32,565
Joe! Joe!

1351
01:42:34,734 --> 01:42:35,860
Joe!

1352
01:42:42,199 --> 01:42:43,284
Joe!

1353
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:20,946
Stars are ageless, aren't they?

1354
01:43:28,537 --> 01:43:33,542
<i>Well, this is where you came in.
Back at that pool again,</i>

1355
01:43:34,543 --> 01:43:37,171
<i>the one I always wanted.</i>

1356
01:43:37,254 --> 01:43:41,133
<i>It's dawn now, and they must have
photographed me a thousand times.</i>

1357
01:43:41,675 --> 01:43:45,638
<i>Then they got a couple of pruning hooks
from the garden and fished me out,</i>

1358
01:43:45,721 --> 01:43:47,306
<i>ever so gently.</i>

1359
01:43:48,224 --> 01:43:51,602
<i>Funny how gentle people get with you
once you're dead.</i>

1360
01:43:53,312 --> 01:43:56,565
<i>They beached me like a harpooned baby whale</i>

1361
01:43:56,649 --> 01:44:00,653
<i>and started to check the damage,
just for the record.</i>

1362
01:44:03,155 --> 01:44:05,533
<i>By this time, the whole joint was jumping.</i>

1363
01:44:05,616 --> 01:44:08,369
<i>Cops, reporters, neighbors, passersby,</i>

1364
01:44:08,661 --> 01:44:10,663
<i>as much whoop-de-doo
as we get in Los Angeles</i>

1365
01:44:10,746 --> 01:44:12,581
<i>when they open a supermarket.</i>

1366
01:44:12,665 --> 01:44:15,418
<i>Even the newsreel guys came roaring in.</i>

1367
01:44:15,501 --> 01:44:18,796
<i>Here was an item
everybody could have some fun with.</i>

1368
01:44:19,964 --> 01:44:22,007
<i>The heartless so-and-sos!</i>

1369
01:44:23,509 --> 01:44:25,594
<i>What would they do to Norma?</i>

1370
01:44:25,678 --> 01:44:30,516
<i>Even if she got away with it in court,
crime of passion, temporary insanity,</i>

1371
01:44:31,350 --> 01:44:34,145
<i>those headlines would kill her.</i>

1372
01:44:34,228 --> 01:44:37,189
<i>"Forgotten Star a Slayer."</i>

1373
01:44:37,273 --> 01:44:41,402
<i>"Aging Actress, Yesterday's Glamour Queen."</i>

1374
01:44:52,371 --> 01:44:56,667
Coroner's office?
I want to speak to the Coroner.

1375
01:44:57,793 --> 01:45:00,171
- Who's on this phone?
- I am!

1376
01:45:00,254 --> 01:45:03,007
Now get off! This is more important.

1377
01:45:03,090 --> 01:45:05,217
<i>Times</i> City Desk? Hedda Hopper speaking.

1378
01:45:05,301 --> 01:45:07,678
I'm talking from the bedroom
of Norma Desmond.

1379
01:45:07,761 --> 01:45:11,640
Don't bother with a re-write, man.
Take it direct. Ready?

1380
01:45:11,724 --> 01:45:13,642
"As day breaks over the murder house,"

1381
01:45:13,726 --> 01:45:16,103
Norma Desmond, famous star of yesteryear,

1382
01:45:16,187 --> 01:45:19,148
is in a state of complete mental shock."

1383
01:45:19,231 --> 01:45:20,816
"A curtain of silence seems
to have fallen around her..."

1384
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:22,443
You don't deny having killed this man,
Miss Desmond?

1385
01:45:22,526 --> 01:45:23,777
"...she sits in the silken boudoir
of her house..."

1386
01:45:23,861 --> 01:45:25,070
Just answer me that!

1387
01:45:25,154 --> 01:45:26,989
Was it a sudden quarrel?

1388
01:45:27,072 --> 01:45:29,992
Had you ever had any trouble
between you before?

1389
01:45:30,075 --> 01:45:33,245
If it was a quarrel,
how come this gun was right there?

1390
01:45:33,329 --> 01:45:36,582
This guy, where did you meet him
for the first time?

1391
01:45:36,665 --> 01:45:38,501
Where did he come from? Who is he?

1392
01:45:38,584 --> 01:45:42,671
Did you hate him? Had you ever thought
of doing something like this before?

1393
01:45:42,755 --> 01:45:45,841
Was theft involved? Did you catch him
trying to steal something?

1394
01:45:45,925 --> 01:45:47,718
Or find he had stolen something?

1395
01:45:47,801 --> 01:45:49,553
The newsreel men are here with the cameras.

1396
01:45:49,637 --> 01:45:53,641
Tell them to go fly a kite!
This is no time for cameras.

1397
01:45:53,724 --> 01:45:57,269
Now, Miss Desmond, is there anything
you want to tell us?

1398
01:45:58,896 --> 01:46:00,189
Cameras?

1399
01:46:03,025 --> 01:46:04,693
What is it, Max?

1400
01:46:09,156 --> 01:46:11,909
- The cameras have arrived.
- They have?

1401
01:46:12,993 --> 01:46:15,913
Tell Mr. DeMille
I'll be on the set at once.

1402
01:46:16,330 --> 01:46:17,873
What is this?

1403
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:25,214
Well, it's one way to get her downstairs.

1404
01:46:26,549 --> 01:46:31,303
Let's have the car right outside. Okay.

1405
01:46:33,055 --> 01:46:36,392
- Everything will be ready, Madame.
- Thank you, Max.

1406
01:46:37,309 --> 01:46:41,230
You'll pardon me, gentlemen,
but I must get ready for my scene.

1407
01:46:43,148 --> 01:46:44,608
- What's happening up there?
- Any statement?

1408
01:46:44,692 --> 01:46:47,528
- Why did she do it?
- Is there a confession?

1409
01:46:48,112 --> 01:46:50,990
- Everything set up, gentlemen?
- Just about.

1410
01:46:51,115 --> 01:46:53,325
- Lights ready?
- All set.

1411
01:47:05,838 --> 01:47:06,839
Okay, fellas.

1412
01:47:11,510 --> 01:47:13,637
Quiet, everybody!

1413
01:47:16,390 --> 01:47:17,641
Lights!

1414
01:47:22,354 --> 01:47:24,565
Are you ready, Norma?

1415
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:30,362
What is the scene? Where am I?

1416
01:47:33,490 --> 01:47:36,910
This is the staircase of the palace!

1417
01:47:38,370 --> 01:47:41,206
Oh, yes, yes...

1418
01:47:42,041 --> 01:47:45,002
Down below, they're waiting
for the princess.

1419
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:49,423
I'm ready.

1420
01:47:50,215 --> 01:47:54,053
All right. Cameras! Action!

1421
01:47:57,514 --> 01:48:01,226
<i>So they were turning after all,
those cameras.</i>

1422
01:48:03,062 --> 01:48:08,275
<i>Life, which can be strangely merciful,
had taken pity on Norma Desmond.</i>

1423
01:48:09,818 --> 01:48:15,074
<i>The dream she had clung to
so desperately had enfolded her.</i>

1424
01:48:43,644 --> 01:48:46,772
I can't go on with the scene.
I'm too happy!

1425
01:48:48,273 --> 01:48:52,152
Mr. DeMille, would you mind
if I say a few words? Thank you.

1426
01:48:53,153 --> 01:48:55,989
I just want to tell you all how happy
I am to be back in the studio,

1427
01:48:56,073 --> 01:48:58,367
making a picture again!

1428
01:48:58,450 --> 01:49:01,829
You don't know
how much I've missed all of you.

1429
01:49:01,912 --> 01:49:04,581
And I promise you,
I'll never desert you again!

1430
01:49:04,665 --> 01:49:09,002
Because after <i>Salome</i>, we'll make
another picture and another picture!

1431
01:49:09,336 --> 01:49:13,006
You see, this is my life!
It always will be!

1432
01:49:13,632 --> 01:49:18,303
There's nothing else.
Just us and the cameras

1433
01:49:19,430 --> 01:49:24,101
and those wonderful people
out there in the dark.

1434
01:49:25,561 --> 01:49:28,772
All right, Mr. DeMille,
I'm ready for my close-up.
